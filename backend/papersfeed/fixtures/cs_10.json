            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COPs) is one of the branches of applied mathematics and computer sciences, which is accompanied by many problems such as Facility Layout Problem (FLP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), etc. Even though the use of several mathematical formulations is employed for FLP, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is one of the most commonly used. One of the major problems of Combinatorial NP-hard Optimization Problem is QAP mathematical model. Consequently, many approaches have been introduced to solve this problem, and these approaches are classified as Approximate and Exact methods. With QAP, each facility is allocated to just one location, thereby reducing cost in terms of aggregate distances weighted by flow values. The primary aim of this study is to propose a hybrid approach which combines Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE) algorithm and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to enhance solutions of QAP model, to reduce the distances between the locations by finding the best distribution of N facilities to N locations, and to implement hybrid approach based on discrete differential evolution (HDDETS) on many instances of QAP from the benchmark. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on several sets of instances from the data set of QAP and the results obtained have shown the effective performance of the proposed algorithm in improving several solutions of QAP in reasonable time. Afterwards, the proposed approach is compared with other recent methods in the literature review. Based on the computation results, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms the other methods.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Quadratic form reduction and lattice reduction are fundamental tools in computational number theory and in computer science, especially in cryptography. The celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz reduction algorithm (so-called LLL) has been improved in many ways through the past decades and remains one of the central methods used for reducing integral lattice basis. In particular, its floating-point variants-where the rational arithmetic required by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic are now the fastest known. However, the systematic study of the reduction theory of real quadratic forms or, more generally, of real lattices is not widely represented in the literature. When the problem arises, the lattice is usually replaced by an integral approximation of (a multiple of) the original lattice, which is then reduced. While practically useful and proven in some special cases, this method doesn't offer any guarantee of success in general. In this work, we present an adaptive-precision version of a generalized LLL algorithm that covers this case in all generality. In particular, we replace floating-point arithmetic by Interval Arithmetic to certify the behavior of the algorithm. We conclude by giving a typical application of the result in algebraic number theory for the reduction of ideal lattices in number fields.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, \"easy\" and \"hard\" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical Definition hereinafter). A twin prime is a prime number that has a prime gap of two, in other words, differs from another prime number by two, for example the twin prime pair (5, 3). The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the twin prime conjecture, which states: There are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime. In this work we define a new notion: \"r-prime number of degree k\" and we give a new RSA trap-door one-way. This notion generalized a twin prime numbers because the twin prime numbers are 2-prime numbers of degree 1.",

            "abstract": "Inversion sequences have intriguing applications in combinatorics, computer sciences and polyhedral geometry. Ascent sequences, as one of the most important subsets of inversion sequences, were introduced by Bousquet-Melou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev to encode the (2 + 2)-free posets. Pattern avoidance in ascent sequences was first studied by Ducan and Steingrimsson in 2011, while the systematic study of patterns in inversion sequences was initiated only recently by Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch and Mansour-Shattuck. In this paper, we investigate systematically the enumeration of inversion or ascent sequences avoiding vincular patterns of length 3, where two of the three letters are required to be adjacent. Our results connect restricted inversion sequences and ascent sequences to a number of well-known combinatorial sequences including Bell numbers, Fishburn numbers, Powered Catalan numbers, Semi-Baxter numbers and the number of 3-noncrossing partitions. A variety of combinatorial bijections, known or newly constructed, are applied to achieve these interesting connections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "The signal processing is one the very important research area in the computer sciences and artificial intelligence. Because, audio recognition, voice activity detection, disease diagnosis, brain activity detection and predictions methods are evaluated using signal processing methods. Nowadays, deep methods have been become popular in the signal processing applications. In this article, a novel hybrid feature extraction network by using novel approximations and multiple pooling method. The proposed method uses both binary pattern (BP) and ternary pattern (TP) as feature extractor. In order to extract variable and distinctive features, dynamic center based feature extraction strategy is used. Hence, the proposed feature extraction network is called as dynamic center based binary and ternary pattern network (DC-BTPNet). The proposed DC-BTPNet is consists of 9 layer. Also, a novel multiple pooling method is used in DC-BTPNet. In order to select features, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is utilized. Finally, the extracted features are forwarded to polynomial kernel support vector machine (SVM). In order to evaluate performance of the proposed method, a novel dataset is created. The proposed DC-BTPNet based multiple learning method achieved 89.0% accuracy rates and it was compared to other state-of-art convolutional networks. Other well-known conventional classifiers are also used for instance linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k nearest neighbor (KNN) and bagged tree (BT) classifiers are used to compare performance of the classifiers. The comparisons and results clearly proved success of the DC-BTPNet. These results demonstrated that the proposed methods can be achieved successful results in larger datasets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of this short time span, the production magnitude (1162 papers) makes it necessary to make a bibliometric study in order to observe research clusters, emerging topics, and leading scholars. Our paper is aimed at studying the scientific production only around bitcoin, excluding other blockchain applications. Thus, we restricted our search to papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, whose topic is \"bitcoin\". This database is suitable for such diverse disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "There is a body of evidence suggesting that instead of concentrating only on teaching and learning (the education task), teachers believe that their tasks are to care for their students social, emotional, and physical needs (the caring task), and to raise them to be and become functional members of society (the socialization task). However, this diversity has not been acknowledged in teachers' beliefs research done in technology integration context. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the variety and role of teachers' beliefs about technology integration this study has synthesized 35 qualitative empirical research studies via the method of meta-ethnography. The focus is on early childhood education (ECE) as so far, no reviews on early childhood teachers' beliefs have been conducted. The synthesis suggests, that education, socialization, and care all have a meaningful role in teachers' beliefs towards technology use in ECE. Each of these tasks and dimensions were identified from teachers' beliefs for or against integrating technology into ECE practices. The synthesis also suggests, that teachers' beliefs are shaped by macro- and micro-contextual factors including national educational policies and personal experiences. Implications for teacher education are discussed.",
