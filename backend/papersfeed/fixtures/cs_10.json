            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COPs) is one of the branches of applied mathematics and computer sciences, which is accompanied by many problems such as Facility Layout Problem (FLP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), etc. Even though the use of several mathematical formulations is employed for FLP, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is one of the most commonly used. One of the major problems of Combinatorial NP-hard Optimization Problem is QAP mathematical model. Consequently, many approaches have been introduced to solve this problem, and these approaches are classified as Approximate and Exact methods. With QAP, each facility is allocated to just one location, thereby reducing cost in terms of aggregate distances weighted by flow values. The primary aim of this study is to propose a hybrid approach which combines Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE) algorithm and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to enhance solutions of QAP model, to reduce the distances between the locations by finding the best distribution of N facilities to N locations, and to implement hybrid approach based on discrete differential evolution (HDDETS) on many instances of QAP from the benchmark. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on several sets of instances from the data set of QAP and the results obtained have shown the effective performance of the proposed algorithm in improving several solutions of QAP in reasonable time. Afterwards, the proposed approach is compared with other recent methods in the literature review. Based on the computation results, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms the other methods.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Quadratic form reduction and lattice reduction are fundamental tools in computational number theory and in computer science, especially in cryptography. The celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz reduction algorithm (so-called LLL) has been improved in many ways through the past decades and remains one of the central methods used for reducing integral lattice basis. In particular, its floating-point variants-where the rational arithmetic required by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic are now the fastest known. However, the systematic study of the reduction theory of real quadratic forms or, more generally, of real lattices is not widely represented in the literature. When the problem arises, the lattice is usually replaced by an integral approximation of (a multiple of) the original lattice, which is then reduced. While practically useful and proven in some special cases, this method doesn't offer any guarantee of success in general. In this work, we present an adaptive-precision version of a generalized LLL algorithm that covers this case in all generality. In particular, we replace floating-point arithmetic by Interval Arithmetic to certify the behavior of the algorithm. We conclude by giving a typical application of the result in algebraic number theory for the reduction of ideal lattices in number fields.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Faculty hiring networks consist of academic departments in a particular field (vertices) and directed edges from the departments that award Ph.D. degrees to students to the institutions that hires them as faculty. Study of these networks has been used in the past to find a hierarchy, or ranking, among departments, but they can also help reveal sociological aspects of a profession that have consequences in the dissemination of educational innovations and knowledge. In this article, we propose to use a new latent variable Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to study faculty hiring networks. The model uses hierarchy information only as an input to the ERGM, where the hierarchy is obtained by modification of the Minimum Violation Ranking (MVR) method recently suggested in the literature. In contrast to single indices of ranking that can only capture partial features of a complex network, we demonstrate how our latent variable ERGM model provides a clustering of departments that does not necessarily align with the hierarchy as given by the MVR rankings, permits to simplify the network for ease of interpretation, and allows us to reproduce its main characteristics including its otherwise difficult to model presence of directed self-edges, common in faculty hiring networks. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our methods with application to the Industrial/Systems/Operations Research (IEOR) faculty hiring network, not studied before. The IEOR network is contrasted with those previously studied for other related disciplines, such as Computer Science and Business.",

            "abstract": "In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, \"easy\" and \"hard\" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical Definition hereinafter). A twin prime is a prime number that has a prime gap of two, in other words, differs from another prime number by two, for example the twin prime pair (5, 3). The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the twin prime conjecture, which states: There are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime. In this work we define a new notion: \"r-prime number of degree k\" and we give a new RSA trap-door one-way. This notion generalized a twin prime numbers because the twin prime numbers are 2-prime numbers of degree 1.",

            "abstract": "Inversion sequences have intriguing applications in combinatorics, computer sciences and polyhedral geometry. Ascent sequences, as one of the most important subsets of inversion sequences, were introduced by Bousquet-Melou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev to encode the (2 + 2)-free posets. Pattern avoidance in ascent sequences was first studied by Ducan and Steingrimsson in 2011, while the systematic study of patterns in inversion sequences was initiated only recently by Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch and Mansour-Shattuck. In this paper, we investigate systematically the enumeration of inversion or ascent sequences avoiding vincular patterns of length 3, where two of the three letters are required to be adjacent. Our results connect restricted inversion sequences and ascent sequences to a number of well-known combinatorial sequences including Bell numbers, Fishburn numbers, Powered Catalan numbers, Semi-Baxter numbers and the number of 3-noncrossing partitions. A variety of combinatorial bijections, known or newly constructed, are applied to achieve these interesting connections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "The signal processing is one the very important research area in the computer sciences and artificial intelligence. Because, audio recognition, voice activity detection, disease diagnosis, brain activity detection and predictions methods are evaluated using signal processing methods. Nowadays, deep methods have been become popular in the signal processing applications. In this article, a novel hybrid feature extraction network by using novel approximations and multiple pooling method. The proposed method uses both binary pattern (BP) and ternary pattern (TP) as feature extractor. In order to extract variable and distinctive features, dynamic center based feature extraction strategy is used. Hence, the proposed feature extraction network is called as dynamic center based binary and ternary pattern network (DC-BTPNet). The proposed DC-BTPNet is consists of 9 layer. Also, a novel multiple pooling method is used in DC-BTPNet. In order to select features, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is utilized. Finally, the extracted features are forwarded to polynomial kernel support vector machine (SVM). In order to evaluate performance of the proposed method, a novel dataset is created. The proposed DC-BTPNet based multiple learning method achieved 89.0% accuracy rates and it was compared to other state-of-art convolutional networks. Other well-known conventional classifiers are also used for instance linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k nearest neighbor (KNN) and bagged tree (BT) classifiers are used to compare performance of the classifiers. The comparisons and results clearly proved success of the DC-BTPNet. These results demonstrated that the proposed methods can be achieved successful results in larger datasets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Estimation of the population size and distribution of individuals is crucial in ecological studies. In many territorial animals, e.g., birds, territory mapping is the method believed to produce absolute and accurate estimators of population size (number of breeding territories). However, the results are highly variable among observers because interpreting maps is subjective and might depend on previous experience, map scale and bulk of data in the map. This technique is also highly laborious. In this work, we present a new approach to the analysis of bird species maps using spatial hierarchical clustering. Observers mapped birds and noted details of their behaviour in a 429 ha forest-grassland mosaic plot in the Beskid Maly Mountains, Poland. Spatial hierarchical clustering uses only a distance criterion to establish a cluster that is considered a proxy of bird territory. The mathematically established (CrimeStat software) number of territories is compared with the number of territories delineated in a traditional manner by three map analysts experienced in field surveys and the method. The map analysts differed in the number of delineated territories. The average coefficient of variation was 64% (range: 0-173%) and intraclass correlation coefficient was lower than for the computer algorithm and mean estimates of the map analysts. Spatial hierarchical clustering estimated the numbers of territories inside the 95% confidence interval for means calculated using the estimates for each species from map analysts. The relative rank abundance (order of the number of territories estimated by spatial hierarchical clustering) was similar to the results estimated by map analysts as indicated by the Wilcoxon paired test and intraclass correlation coefficient which exceeded a value of 0.9. Higher-order clusters (clusters of \"territories\") were also found. Although the presented method uses only the distance criterion, it produces results comparable to the traditional interpretation from maps. The advantage of the presented approach is that it generates repeatable results that are free of subjectivity and independent of observer experience and might supply additional information on the distribution of the territories and perhaps their size. The method might also identify areas of high suitability and can be successfully applied to any territorial animal. Further development should be directed towards inclusion of animal behaviour and simultaneous records of different individuals in the algorithm that calculates clusters.",

            "title": "Depth-4 Lower Bounds, Determinantal Complexity: A Unified Approach",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Tavenas (Proceedings of mathematical foundations of computer science (MFCS), 2013) has recently proved that any nO(1)-variate and degree n polynomial in VP can be computed by a depth-4 S.S. circuit of size 2O(v n log n). So, to prove VP = VNP it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial in VNP of degree n requires 2.(v n log n) size depth-4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas' result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds of 2O(v n log n) have been proved (see Kayal et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014b. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2591796. 2591847; Fournier et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014). In particular, using a combinatorial design Kayal et al. (2014b) construct an explicit polynomial in VNP that requires depth-4 circuits of size 2O(v n log n) and Fournier et al. (Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014) show that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in VP) also requires 2O(v n log n) size depth-4 circuits. In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any polynomial f that satisfies this property would achieve a similar depth4 circuit-size lower bound. In particular, it does not matter whether f is in VP or in VNP. As a result, we get a simple unified lower-bound analysis for the above-mentioned polynomials. Another goal of this paper is to compare our current knowledge of the depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds and the determinantal complexity lower bounds. Currently, the best known determinantal complexity lower bound is O(n2) for permanent of a n x n matrix (which is a n2variate and degree n polynomial) due to Cai et al. (Proceedings of symposium on th eory of computing, ACM, 2008). We prove that the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial is O(dn) where d is the number of matrices and n is the dimension of the matrices. In particular, our result settles the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial to T(dn). To the best of our knowledge, a T(n) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for any constant d > 1, due to Jansen (Theory Comput Syst 49(2):343-354, 2011).",
