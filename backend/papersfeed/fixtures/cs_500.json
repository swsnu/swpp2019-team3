            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COPs) is one of the branches of applied mathematics and computer sciences, which is accompanied by many problems such as Facility Layout Problem (FLP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), etc. Even though the use of several mathematical formulations is employed for FLP, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is one of the most commonly used. One of the major problems of Combinatorial NP-hard Optimization Problem is QAP mathematical model. Consequently, many approaches have been introduced to solve this problem, and these approaches are classified as Approximate and Exact methods. With QAP, each facility is allocated to just one location, thereby reducing cost in terms of aggregate distances weighted by flow values. The primary aim of this study is to propose a hybrid approach which combines Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE) algorithm and Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to enhance solutions of QAP model, to reduce the distances between the locations by finding the best distribution of N facilities to N locations, and to implement hybrid approach based on discrete differential evolution (HDDETS) on many instances of QAP from the benchmark. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on several sets of instances from the data set of QAP and the results obtained have shown the effective performance of the proposed algorithm in improving several solutions of QAP in reasonable time. Afterwards, the proposed approach is compared with other recent methods in the literature review. Based on the computation results, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms the other methods.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Quadratic form reduction and lattice reduction are fundamental tools in computational number theory and in computer science, especially in cryptography. The celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz reduction algorithm (so-called LLL) has been improved in many ways through the past decades and remains one of the central methods used for reducing integral lattice basis. In particular, its floating-point variants-where the rational arithmetic required by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic are now the fastest known. However, the systematic study of the reduction theory of real quadratic forms or, more generally, of real lattices is not widely represented in the literature. When the problem arises, the lattice is usually replaced by an integral approximation of (a multiple of) the original lattice, which is then reduced. While practically useful and proven in some special cases, this method doesn't offer any guarantee of success in general. In this work, we present an adaptive-precision version of a generalized LLL algorithm that covers this case in all generality. In particular, we replace floating-point arithmetic by Interval Arithmetic to certify the behavior of the algorithm. We conclude by giving a typical application of the result in algebraic number theory for the reduction of ideal lattices in number fields.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Faculty hiring networks consist of academic departments in a particular field (vertices) and directed edges from the departments that award Ph.D. degrees to students to the institutions that hires them as faculty. Study of these networks has been used in the past to find a hierarchy, or ranking, among departments, but they can also help reveal sociological aspects of a profession that have consequences in the dissemination of educational innovations and knowledge. In this article, we propose to use a new latent variable Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to study faculty hiring networks. The model uses hierarchy information only as an input to the ERGM, where the hierarchy is obtained by modification of the Minimum Violation Ranking (MVR) method recently suggested in the literature. In contrast to single indices of ranking that can only capture partial features of a complex network, we demonstrate how our latent variable ERGM model provides a clustering of departments that does not necessarily align with the hierarchy as given by the MVR rankings, permits to simplify the network for ease of interpretation, and allows us to reproduce its main characteristics including its otherwise difficult to model presence of directed self-edges, common in faculty hiring networks. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our methods with application to the Industrial/Systems/Operations Research (IEOR) faculty hiring network, not studied before. The IEOR network is contrasted with those previously studied for other related disciplines, such as Computer Science and Business.",

            "abstract": "In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, \"easy\" and \"hard\" are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems. Not being one-to-one is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical Definition hereinafter). A twin prime is a prime number that has a prime gap of two, in other words, differs from another prime number by two, for example the twin prime pair (5, 3). The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in number theory for many years. This is the content of the twin prime conjecture, which states: There are infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime. In this work we define a new notion: \"r-prime number of degree k\" and we give a new RSA trap-door one-way. This notion generalized a twin prime numbers because the twin prime numbers are 2-prime numbers of degree 1.",

            "abstract": "Inversion sequences have intriguing applications in combinatorics, computer sciences and polyhedral geometry. Ascent sequences, as one of the most important subsets of inversion sequences, were introduced by Bousquet-Melou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev to encode the (2 + 2)-free posets. Pattern avoidance in ascent sequences was first studied by Ducan and Steingrimsson in 2011, while the systematic study of patterns in inversion sequences was initiated only recently by Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch and Mansour-Shattuck. In this paper, we investigate systematically the enumeration of inversion or ascent sequences avoiding vincular patterns of length 3, where two of the three letters are required to be adjacent. Our results connect restricted inversion sequences and ascent sequences to a number of well-known combinatorial sequences including Bell numbers, Fishburn numbers, Powered Catalan numbers, Semi-Baxter numbers and the number of 3-noncrossing partitions. A variety of combinatorial bijections, known or newly constructed, are applied to achieve these interesting connections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "The signal processing is one the very important research area in the computer sciences and artificial intelligence. Because, audio recognition, voice activity detection, disease diagnosis, brain activity detection and predictions methods are evaluated using signal processing methods. Nowadays, deep methods have been become popular in the signal processing applications. In this article, a novel hybrid feature extraction network by using novel approximations and multiple pooling method. The proposed method uses both binary pattern (BP) and ternary pattern (TP) as feature extractor. In order to extract variable and distinctive features, dynamic center based feature extraction strategy is used. Hence, the proposed feature extraction network is called as dynamic center based binary and ternary pattern network (DC-BTPNet). The proposed DC-BTPNet is consists of 9 layer. Also, a novel multiple pooling method is used in DC-BTPNet. In order to select features, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is utilized. Finally, the extracted features are forwarded to polynomial kernel support vector machine (SVM). In order to evaluate performance of the proposed method, a novel dataset is created. The proposed DC-BTPNet based multiple learning method achieved 89.0% accuracy rates and it was compared to other state-of-art convolutional networks. Other well-known conventional classifiers are also used for instance linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k nearest neighbor (KNN) and bagged tree (BT) classifiers are used to compare performance of the classifiers. The comparisons and results clearly proved success of the DC-BTPNet. These results demonstrated that the proposed methods can be achieved successful results in larger datasets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Estimation of the population size and distribution of individuals is crucial in ecological studies. In many territorial animals, e.g., birds, territory mapping is the method believed to produce absolute and accurate estimators of population size (number of breeding territories). However, the results are highly variable among observers because interpreting maps is subjective and might depend on previous experience, map scale and bulk of data in the map. This technique is also highly laborious. In this work, we present a new approach to the analysis of bird species maps using spatial hierarchical clustering. Observers mapped birds and noted details of their behaviour in a 429 ha forest-grassland mosaic plot in the Beskid Maly Mountains, Poland. Spatial hierarchical clustering uses only a distance criterion to establish a cluster that is considered a proxy of bird territory. The mathematically established (CrimeStat software) number of territories is compared with the number of territories delineated in a traditional manner by three map analysts experienced in field surveys and the method. The map analysts differed in the number of delineated territories. The average coefficient of variation was 64% (range: 0-173%) and intraclass correlation coefficient was lower than for the computer algorithm and mean estimates of the map analysts. Spatial hierarchical clustering estimated the numbers of territories inside the 95% confidence interval for means calculated using the estimates for each species from map analysts. The relative rank abundance (order of the number of territories estimated by spatial hierarchical clustering) was similar to the results estimated by map analysts as indicated by the Wilcoxon paired test and intraclass correlation coefficient which exceeded a value of 0.9. Higher-order clusters (clusters of \"territories\") were also found. Although the presented method uses only the distance criterion, it produces results comparable to the traditional interpretation from maps. The advantage of the presented approach is that it generates repeatable results that are free of subjectivity and independent of observer experience and might supply additional information on the distribution of the territories and perhaps their size. The method might also identify areas of high suitability and can be successfully applied to any territorial animal. Further development should be directed towards inclusion of animal behaviour and simultaneous records of different individuals in the algorithm that calculates clusters.",

            "title": "Depth-4 Lower Bounds, Determinantal Complexity: A Unified Approach",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Tavenas (Proceedings of mathematical foundations of computer science (MFCS), 2013) has recently proved that any nO(1)-variate and degree n polynomial in VP can be computed by a depth-4 S.S. circuit of size 2O(v n log n). So, to prove VP = VNP it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial in VNP of degree n requires 2.(v n log n) size depth-4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas' result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds of 2O(v n log n) have been proved (see Kayal et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014b. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2591796. 2591847; Fournier et al. in Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014). In particular, using a combinatorial design Kayal et al. (2014b) construct an explicit polynomial in VNP that requires depth-4 circuits of size 2O(v n log n) and Fournier et al. (Proceedings of symposium on theory of computing, ACM, 2014) show that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in VP) also requires 2O(v n log n) size depth-4 circuits. In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any polynomial f that satisfies this property would achieve a similar depth4 circuit-size lower bound. In particular, it does not matter whether f is in VP or in VNP. As a result, we get a simple unified lower-bound analysis for the above-mentioned polynomials. Another goal of this paper is to compare our current knowledge of the depth-4 circuit-size lower bounds and the determinantal complexity lower bounds. Currently, the best known determinantal complexity lower bound is O(n2) for permanent of a n x n matrix (which is a n2variate and degree n polynomial) due to Cai et al. (Proceedings of symposium on th eory of computing, ACM, 2008). We prove that the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial is O(dn) where d is the number of matrices and n is the dimension of the matrices. In particular, our result settles the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial to T(dn). To the best of our knowledge, a T(n) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for any constant d > 1, due to Jansen (Theory Comput Syst 49(2):343-354, 2011).",

Discursive practices are interactional and practical activities for making sense of who and what we encounter. In this article, I analyze the limitation of anthropomorphism as another important activity to investigate. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a robotics research group, I show the importance of the limitation of anthropomorphism by documenting how it contributes to research group identity.

            "abstract": "There is a body of evidence suggesting that instead of concentrating only on teaching and learning (the education task), teachers believe that their tasks are to care for their students social, emotional, and physical needs (the caring task), and to raise them to be and become functional members of society (the socialization task). However, this diversity has not been acknowledged in teachers' beliefs research done in technology integration context. To provide a more nuanced understanding of the variety and role of teachers' beliefs about technology integration this study has synthesized 35 qualitative empirical research studies via the method of meta-ethnography. The focus is on early childhood education (ECE) as so far, no reviews on early childhood teachers' beliefs have been conducted. The synthesis suggests, that education, socialization, and care all have a meaningful role in teachers' beliefs towards technology use in ECE. Each of these tasks and dimensions were identified from teachers' beliefs for or against integrating technology into ECE practices. The synthesis also suggests, that teachers' beliefs are shaped by macro- and micro-contextual factors including national educational policies and personal experiences. Implications for teacher education are discussed.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Human-Computer interaction, including technology-aided instruction, is beginning to focus on virtual reality (VR) technology due to its ability to support immersive learning, teaching through simulation, and gamification of learning. These systems can deliver high-level multisensory learning experiences that are important in the teaching of many subjects, especially those involving abstract concepts or requiring spatial skills, such as organic chemistry. Haptic experiences with VR, however, remain a challenge. In addition, development has focused on general entertainment/gaming; VR systems in chemistry implement simulations of the chemistry laboratory and other advanced systems whereas those that support safe, game-like, immersive and multisensory learning of organic chemistry with haptics at pre-university education levels are scarce. We developed the VR Multisensory Classroom (VRMC) as an immersive learning environment within a VR head-mounted display, where learners employ hand movements to build hydrocarbon molecules and experience haptic feedback through gloves with built-in sensors and hand-tracking with the Leap Motion system. We report here the evaluation of the first prototype by learners from diverse backgrounds who reported on the ability of the VRMC to support high engagement, motivation, interest and organic chemistry learning as well as diverse learning styles. The VRMC is a novel VR classroom that supports immersive learning in molecular organic chemistry with haptics for multisensory learning.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The purpose of this review article is to present state-of-the-art approaches and examples of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems, applications and experiences which improve student learning and the generalization of skills to the real world. Thus, we provide a brief, representative and non-exhaustive review of the current research studies, in order to examine the effects, as well as the impact of VR/AR technologies on K-12, higher and tertiary education students' twenty-first century skills and their overall learning. According to the literature, there are promising results indicating that VR/AR environments improve learning outcomes and present numerous advantages of investing time and financial resources in K-12, higher and tertiary educational settings. Technological tools such as VR/AR improve digital-age literacy, creative thinking, communication, collaboration and problem solving ability, which constitute the so-called twenty-first century skills, necessary to transform information rather than just receive it. VR/AR enhances traditional curricula in order to enable diverse learning needs of students. Research and development relative to VR/AR technology is focused on a whole ecosystem around smart phones, including applications and educational content, games and social networks, creating immersive three-dimensional spatial experiences addressing new ways of human-computer interaction. Raising the level of engagement, promoting self-learning, enabling multi-sensory learning, enhancing spatial ability, confidence and enjoyment, promoting student-centered technology, combination of virtual and real objects in a real setting and decreasing cognitive load are some of the pedagogical advantages discussed. Additionally, implications of a growing VR/AR industry investment in educational sector are provided. It can be concluded that despite the fact that there are various barriers and challenges in front of the adoption of virtual reality on educational practices, VR/AR applications provide an effective tool to enhance learning and memory, as they provide immersed multimodal environments enriched by multiple sensory features.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Multivariate interpolation is a fundamental and long-studied problem, which has numerous applications in mathematics, engineering, computer science, and the natural sciences. A basic tool for solving the problem of high-dimensional interpolation is through the usage of radial basis functions (RBFs). In fact, the combination of interpolation and RBFs can lead to very good properties in high dimensions. Unfortunately, the linear system of equations derived from the approximations of RBFs with a high order of convergence is ill-conditioned and unstable, and usually includes a full interpolation matrix. To solve such a system of equations, we face a very high computational cost if the dimension of the problems or the number of data points is increased. This can also lead to intense instability in the considered problem, and the condition number of the system of equations, as a measure of the ill-conditioning criterion, will be very large. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a layer-by-layer interpolation approach for solving scattered data approximation of an unknown multivariate function, where the information of this approximation problem has been given in certain layers. In this approach, by creating a layered structure, the computational cost is reduced and decreasing the condition number is also possible. This structure provides a possibility for encountering a much smaller linear system of equations. In other words, it increases the accuracy and the stability of the numerical structure of the considered interpolation. The new method can ensure the existence and the uniqueness of the solution for the multilayer interpolation problem. We also find that the layer-by-layer approach provides more numerically stable calculations than the traditional interpolation method. The new approach is applied for certain numerical examples in high dimensions and the obtained results confirm the high accuracy and the low computational cost of the proposed method. Finally, our approach is applied to explore one of the air pollution indexes, i.e., ozone concentration, which has been based on different stations in Tehran, Iran.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In computer vision, image segmentation plays an indispensable role. Image segmentation is used to find objects and their boundary limits in images. In medical imaging, tasks such as finding pathological regions and automatic detection of diseases are a complicated problem for computer science and image processing. This problem is intricate because of insufficient clarity of images. High segmentation accuracy, efficiency, reliability, and ability to handle noise or inhomogeneous intensity are some of the desired characteristics of a good segmentation algorithm for medical images. This study proposes an automatic computer-aided system that has been developed by using a level-set region-based active contour segmentation algorithm for edge detection of 2D medical images with and without inhomogeneous intensity. In this method, cancer images are segmented in the transformed domain, which helps to reduce the noise. The proposed segmentation algorithm combines the local geometric properties and local image fitting properties to correctly identify the pixels corresponding to different regions, in images with or without intensity inhomogeneity. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed with panoramic radiograph, Matrix Laboratory. In the experiments, the proposed method outperforms the baselines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to reveal research trends over the last six years by content analysis and to examine bibliometric results of articles related to the use of augmented reality (AR) in science education. For bibliometric mapping analysis, a total of 147 articles were accessed and for content analysis, a total of 79 articles published between 2013 and 2018 years were included from the Web of Science. From this, a total of 62 articles were selected for analysis. Our results revealed that mobile learning, science education, science learning and e-learning were the most used keywords in articles, while the focus of more recent articles tended to be on mobile learning. The results showed that recent articles have mostly focused on mobile learning and e-learning environments. The most-used words in the abstracts were education, knowledge, science education, experiment and effectiveness. It is evident that recent articles have focused mostly on students' knowledge and achievement. Azuma, Dunleavy and Klopfer are the most cited authors in this field. This is not surprising as they are probably the leading authors on AR in the literature. The most cited journals are Computers & Education, Journal of Science Education & Technology, Educational Technology and Society, Computers in Human Behavior, and British Journal of Educational Technology. These are the most prominent journals on the use of technology in education. Content analysis results showed that \"Learning/Academic Achievement\", \"Motivation\" and \"Attitude\" have been the most examined variables in the articles. Since academic achievement is highly influenced by motivation and attitude, it is understandable that these variables are considered together in reviewed studies. It was found that mobile applications and marker-based materials on paper have been the most-favored types of materials for AR because these types of materials are easy to use and they can be developed easily and practically. Quantitative studies were the most used research design type but there have been only a limited number of qualitative studies in the last six years. This may be due to the increased tendency to use quantitative and mixed studies in recent years.",

            "abstract": "Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) leverages technology and concept mapping to support conceptual understanding, as well as collaborative learning to foster knowledge co-construction. This article investigated the effect of different instructional designs using CSCCM on students' conceptual understanding, and on the type of processes of knowledge co-construction that students engage. Participants (N = 120) were 10th graders enrolled in their physics course, randomly distributed in dyads. They were asked to draw concept maps related to the conservation of energy law, by using CSCCM with different instructional designs (i.e., control, Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). In the control condition, dyads worked collaboratively all the time. In both Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, dyads worked first individually (one week) and then collaboratively (two weeks). However, in Exp. 2, the individual concept map was shared with the peer before collaborating. Conceptual understanding improved significantly for learners in all three experimental conditions, especially in Exp. 2. Statistically significant differences were found in students' knowledge co-construction among the three conditions. Dyads in the control group showed a significantly higher use of quick consensus-building. Dyads in Exp. 1 showed a significantly higher reliance on externalization and elicitation. Dyads in Exp. 2 showed a significantly higher enacting of integration- and conflict-oriented consensus building. Accordingly, an instructional design like Exp. 2 optimizes CSCCM learning outcomes in terms of conceptual understanding and knowledge co-construction.",

We employed both automatic facial emotion detection as well as subjective ratings to evaluate emotional engagement of adult participants completing either a game-based numerical task or a non-game-based equivalent. Using a machine learning approach on facial emotion detection data we were able to predict whether individual participants were engaged in the game-based or non-game-based task with classification accuracy significantly above chance level. Moreover, facial emotion detection as well as subjective ratings consistently indicated increased positive as well as negative emotions during game-based learning. These results substantiate that the emotionally engaging nature of games facilitates learning.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Block-based programming languages are becoming increasingly common in introductory computer science classrooms across the K-12 spectrum. One justification for the use of block-based environments in formal educational settings is the idea that the concepts and practices developed using these introductory tools will prepare learners for future computer science learning opportunities. This view is built on the assumption that the attitudinal and conceptual learning gains made while working in the introductory block-based environments will transfer to conventional text-based programming languages. To test this hypothesis, this paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental classroom study in which programming novices spent five-week using either a block-based or text-based programming environment. After five weeks in the introductory tool, students transitioned to Java, a conventional text-based programming language. The study followed students for 10 weeks after the transition. Over the course of the 15-week study, attitudinal and conceptual assessments were administered and student-authored programs were collected. Conceptual learning, attitudinal shifts, and changes in programming practices were analyzed to evaluate how introductory modality impacted learners as they transitioned to a professional, text-based programming language. The findings from this study build on earlier work that found a difference in performance on content assessments after the introductory portion of the study (Weintrop & Wilensky, 2017a). This paper shows the difference in conceptual learning that emerged after five weeks between the block-based and text-based conditions fades after 10 weeks in Java. No differences in programming practices were found between the two conditions while working in Java. Likewise, differences in attitudinal measures that emerged after working in the introductory environments also faded after 10 weeks in Java, resulting in no difference between the conditions after 15 weeks. The contribution of this work is to advance our understanding of the benefits and limits of block-based programming tools in preparing students for future computer science learning. This paper presents the first quasi-experimental study of the transfer of knowledge between block-based and text-based environments in a high school setting. The lack of significant differences between the two introductory programming modalities after learners transition to professional programming languages is discussed along with the implications of these findings for computer science education researchers and educators, as well as for the broader community of researchers studying the role of technology in education.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an important problem in computer science which consists in finding a path linking a set of cities so that each of then can be visited once, before the traveler comes back to the starting point. This is highly relevant because several real world problems can be mapped to it. A special case of TSP is the one in which the cities (the points to be visited) are not static as the cities, but mobile, changing their positions as the time passes. This variation is known as Moving Target TSP (MT-TSP). Emerging systems for crowd monitoring and control based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be mapped to this variation of the TSP problem, as a number of persons (targets) in the crowd can be assigned to be monitored by a given number of UAVs, which by their turn divide the targets among them. These target persons have to be visited from time to time, in a similar way to the cities in the traditional TSP. Aiming at finding a suitable solution for this type of crowd monitoring application, and considering the fact that exact solutions are too complex to perform in a reasonable time, this work explores and compares different heuristic methods for the intended solution. The performed experiments showed that the Genetic Algorithms present the best performance in finding acceptable solutions for the problem in restricted time and processing power situations, performing better compared to Ant Colony Optimization and Simulated Annealing Algorithms.

            "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore the effects of an alternative learning environment, such as the video game making (VGM) within science content, on computational thinking (CT) skills development and student performance. Design/methodology/approach A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Originality/value Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency. Such interdisciplinary educational environments could be applied in the typical school settings to promote a plethora of skills and academic contents.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Increase in complexity of real world problems has provided an area to explore efficient methods to solve computer science problems. Meta-heuristic methods based on evolutionary computations and swarm intelligence are instances of techniques inspired by nature. This paper presents a novel social mimic optimization (SMO) algorithm inspired by mimicking behavior to solve optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using 23 test functions. Obtained results are compared with 14 known optimization algorithms including Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Stochastic fractal search (SFS), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Optics Inspired Optimization (OIO), League Championship Algorithm (LCA), Wind Driven Optimization (WDO), Harmony search (HS), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO), Bat Algorithm (BA), and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). Obtained results indicate higher capability of the SMO algorithm in solving high-dimensional decision variables. Furthermore, SMO is used to solve two classic engineering design problems. Three important features of SMO are simple implementation, solving optimization problems with minimum population size and not requiring control parameters. Results of various evaluations show superiority of the proposed method in finding the optimal solution with minimum function evaluations. This superiority is achieved based on reducing number of initial population. The proposed method can be applied to applications like automatic evolution of robotics, automatic control of machines and innovation of machines in finding better solutions with less cost.

The Minimum Cycle Cover Problem aims to find a cycle cover of cost at most lambda with the minimum number of cycles. An O(n(2)) 24/5-approximation algorithm and an O(n(5)) 14/3-approximation algorithm are given by Yu and Liu (Improved approximation algorithms for some min-max cycle cover problems. Theoretical Computer Science 654 (2016) 45-58). However, the original proofs for approximation ratios are incomplete. In this paper we first present a corrected simplified analysis on the 24/5-approximation algorithm. Based on the simplified approach of analysis and some new observations, we present a new 14/3-approximation algorithm that runs in O(n(3)) and give an improved 32/7-approximation algorithm that runs in O (n(5)).

            "abstract": "Epigenomics is the study of modifications on the genetic material of a cell that do not depend on changes in the DNA sequence, since those latter involve specific proteins around which DNA wraps. The end result is that Epigenomic changes have a fundamental role in the proper working of each cell in Eukaryotic organisms. A particularly important part of Epigenomics concentrates on the study of chromatin, that is, a fiber composed of a DNA-protein complex and very characterizing of Eukaryotes. Understanding how chromatin is assembled and how it changes is fundamental for Biology. In more than thirty years of research in this area, Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science have gained a prominent role, in terms of modeling and mining, regarding in particular the so-called 10 nm fiber. Starting from some very basic notions of Biology, we briefly illustrate the recent advances obtained via laboratory experiments on the organization and dynamics of chromatin. Then, we mainly concentrate our attention on the contributions given by Combinatorial and Informational Methodologies, that are at the hearth of Theoretical Computer Science, to the understanding of mechanisms determining the 10 nm fiber. We conclude highlighting several directions of investigation that are perceived as important and where Theoretical Computer Science can provide high impact results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstract": "Purpose Digital learning has become a global trend. Partly or fully automatic learning systems are integrated into education in schools and universities on a previously unseen scale. Learning systems have a lot of potential for re-education, life-long learning and for increasing access to educational resources. Learning systems create massive amounts of data about learning behaviour. Analysing that data for educational decision making has become an important track of research. The purpose of this paper is to analyse data from an intermediate-level computer science course, which was taught to 141 students in spring 2018 at University of Turku, Department of Future Technologies, Finland. Design/methodology/approach The available variables included number of submissions, submission times, variables of groupwork and final grades. Associations between these variables were looked at to reveal patterns in students' learning behaviour. Findings It was found that time usage differs per different grades so that students with grade 4 out of 5 used most time. Also, it was found that studying at night is connected to weaker learning outcomes than studying during daytime. Several issues in relation to groupwork were revealed. For example, associations were found between prior skills, preference for individual vs groupwork, and course learning outcomes. Originality/value The paper points a number of important ideas for future research. One important observation is that some research questions in learning analytics need qualitative approaches, which need to be added to the toolbox of learning analytics research.",

            "abstract": "We establish a strong link between two apparently unrelated topics: the study of conflicting information in the formal framework of valuation algebras, and the phenomena of non-locality and contextuality. In particular, we show that these peculiar features of quantum theory are mathematically equivalent to a general notion of disagreement between information sources. This result vastly generalizes previously observed connections between contextuality, relational databases, constraint satisfaction problems and logical paradoxes, and gives further proof that contextual behaviour is not a phenomenon limited to quantum physics, but pervades various domains of mathematics and computer science. The connection allows to translate theorems, methods and algorithms from one field to the other, and paves the way for the application of generic inference algorithms to study contextuality.

            "abstract": "The modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing and cybersecurity to cope with system complexity, increase information visibility, improve production performance, and gain competitive advantages in the global market. These advances are rapidly enabling a new generation of smart manufacturing, i.e., a cyber-physical system tightly integrating manufacturing enterprises in the physical world with virtual enterprises in cyberspace. To a great extent, realizing the full potential of cyber-physical systems depends on the development of new methodologies on the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IoMT) for data-enabled engineering innovations. This article presents a review of the IoT technologies and systems that are the drivers and foundations of data-driven innovations in smart manufacturing. We discuss the evolution of internet from computer networks to human networks to the latest era of smart and connected networks of manufacturing things (e.g., materials, sensors, equipment, people, products, and supply chain). In addition, we present a new framework that leverages IoMT and cloud computing to develop a virtual machine network. We further extend our review to IoMT cybersecurity issues that are of paramount importance to businesses and operations, as well as IoT and smart manufacturing policies that are laid out by governments around the world for the future of smart factory. Finally, we present the challenges and opportunities arising from IoMT. We hope this work will help catalyze more in-depth investigations and multi-disciplinary research efforts to advance IoMT technologies.",

            "abstract": "Utilizing advanced information technology to identify the intellectual structure of patents is important for the fast-emerging cloud computing industry; however, related literature is limited. Because the existing three categories of cloud computing business mode are partially overlapped, the customary SPI model as a basis for patent analysis is unable to grasp the development status of cloud computing correctly. The aims of this study are to obtain clustering of cloud patent with overlapping claims and to identify the intellectual structure of different research themes in the development of cloud computing. This study first proposes an ontology-based compound retrieval policy to retrieve three non-overlapped cloud patents. We then propose a new overlapping cluster algorithm using the patents with the highest degree centralities as the initial central points for clustering, and utilizing the Taguchi and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution methods for integrating the clustering quality-related indices. Based on the database of the three overlapped clusters of cloud computing patents, we propose a group technology-based co-word analysis, incorporating with the visual methods of social network analysis and multivariate analysis, to investigate the R&D themes in each service mode of cloud computing. Based on the analysis results, technologies related to computer-readable storage medium and computer program are of particular interest to the SaaS enterprises. The virtual machine technologies are the major development directions of PaaS enterprises, and virtual computing environment has gained many attentions from the IaaS enterprises. The proposed method for exploring the intellectual structure, as well as the analyzed results for unveiling the development status of cloud computing and the co-opetition relationship between companies, can provide valuable references for cloud-related companies to make their R&D management strategy.",

            "abstract": "Digital libraries containing scholarly publications are common today. They are an invaluable source of information to students, researchers, and practitioners. However, many digital libraries expose only the article metadata like title, author names, publication date, and the abstract for free; access to full-text requires access toll. Given that journal subscription charges are sometimes prohibitive, many important publications remain beyond the access of researchers, especially in developing countries. While open access publication solves this issue, the hard reality is that many research papers are not currently available for free reading or download. In this paper, we present a novel approach to alleviate this problem. We present a technique to retrieve open access surrogates of a scholarly article when the latter is unavailable freely in a digital library. Surrogates are articles semantically close to the original articles, written by the same author(s) and give valuable insights into the paper being searched for; they address the same or a very similar problem using the same or very similar techniques. Our focus on approximate matches of scholarly articles distinguishes our application from many academic search engines. We run it on a large corpus of computer science papers and compare the results with human judgment. Experimental results show that our tool can indeed identify relevant OA surrogates of access-restricted papers.",

            "abstract": "Human spatial concepts, such as the concept of place, are not immediately translatable to the geometric foundations of spatial databases and information systems developed over the past 50 years. These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human-computer interaction, but also for location-based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human-machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined.",

Configural, metric and scalar equivalence were found in a multigroup exploratory structural equation model. In the regression model, a significantly positive association between interest in ICT and student achievement was found in China, in contrast to a significantly negative association in Germany. All achievement scores were negatively and significantly correlated with perceived ICT competence scores in China, whereas science and mathematics achievement scores were not predicted by scores on ICT competence in Germany. Similar patterns were found in China and Germany in terms of perceived autonomy in using ICT and social relatedness in using ICT to predict students' achievement.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Biological data is accumulating at an unprecedented rate, escalating the role of data-driven methods in computational drug discovery. This scenario is favored by recent advances in machine learning algorithms, which are optimized for huge datasets and consistently beat the predictive performance of previous art, rapidly approaching human expert reasoning. The urge to couple biological data to cutting-edge machine learning has spurred developments in data integration and knowledge representation, especially in the form of heterogeneous, multiplex and semantically-rich biological networks. Today, thanks to the propitious rise in knowledge embedding techniques, these large and complex biological networks can be converted to a vector format that suits the majority of machine learning implementations. Here, we explain why this can be particularly transformative for drug discovery where, for decades, customary chemoinformatics methods have employed vector descriptors of compound structures as the standard input of their prediction tasks. A common vector format to represent biology and chemistry may push biological information into most of the existing steps of the drug discovery pipeline, boosting the accuracy of predictions and uncovering connections between small molecules and other biological entities such as targets or diseases.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "This article discusses the possibility of adopting a complexity theory approach to the study of language policy and planning (LPP). Besides, it argues that agent-based modelling provides a significant support in this sense. Indeed, while agent-based modelling has become a major ally of researchers in the social sciences, it remains largely unexploited in the study of language-related issues in society. As a central tool of complexity theory, agent-based models (ABMs) lend themselves particularly well to the study of all sorts of complex systems. To provide justification for the use of ABMs in LPP, I show how language issues display the typical traits of complex systems and how ABMs can easily translate ideas and notions from the literature into computer-simulated processes. To support my argument, I discuss communication within multinational corporations as an example of a highly complex language matter. In particular, I focus on how language skills impact the process of knowledge creation and knowledge sharing among employees. By means of a model based on a number of straightforward rules, I show how poor language skills (or an utter lack thereof) risks creating an unbalanced distribution of knowledge (and, consequently, of power) across language groups and how this unbalanced distribution is very sensitive to initial conditions. On the contrary, average language skills seem to support communication well enough to avoid skews that favour even slightly more numerous language groups.",

            "title": "The future of coastal and estuarine modeling: Findings from a workshop",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "This paper summarizes the findings of a workshop convened in the United States in 2018 to discuss methods in coastal and estuarine modeling and to propose key areas of research and development needed to improve their accuracy and reliability. The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods, in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms, vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air-sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics. Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels. This will require a shift in the way proposals related to coastal ocean modeling are reviewed and funded.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Computer Science (CS) education is being increasingly included in primary school curricula across New Zealand. As a group, Pasifika students are less likely to engage with CS at tertiary level and in the workforce, so understanding more about their engagement with school level CS seems important. A multiple case-study design was used to explore the nature of engagement with CS for six Year 7 and 8 Pasifika students. Data were collected via a drawing task, semi-structured interviews and observations of CS teaching sessions then analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Four themes emerged as important to participant engagement with CS: participation, reification, imagination and alignment. Additionally, several potential barriers and enablers were identified across three broad themes: access, perceptions and affect. Results highlight Pasifika students' need for adequate access to CS education and intentional teaching around its purpose and relevance to their current and future identities.",

            "abstract": "This article examines bots - software applications that automate web-based tasks, and which often mimic human interaction and communication - to consider sociological responses to software design and computer programming. Leveraging design methodologies for critical sociological purposes (a) allows us to envision programming as a means of opening up 'black boxes' by engaging more directly with the code through which software applications are executed, and (b) indicates the potential for sociology practitioners to design software ourselves - to build applications that fulfil the radical promise of sociology by intervening in social processes. To concretise these ideas, this article presents two stories about social media bots developed by the author: 'Philbot' (a Facebook random status generator) and '' (a Twitter service that provides mock lifestyle advice to users). On the basis of this demonstration, the article proposes a near-future vision of sociology where Programming-as-Social-Science features as a core research method/skill/tool.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The proliferation of mobile, online, and remote monitoring technologies in digital geriatric mental health has the potential to lead to the next major breakthrough in mental health treatments. Unlike traditional mental health services, digital geriatric mental health has the benefit of serving a large number of older adults, and in many instances, does not rely on mental health clinics to offer real-time interventions. As technology increasingly becomes essential in the everyday lives of older adults with mental health conditions, these technologies will provide a fundamental service delivery strategy to support older adults' mental health recovery. Although ample research on digital geriatric mental health is available, fundamental gaps in the scientific literature still exist. To begin to address these gaps, we propose the following recommendations for a future research agenda: 1) additional proof-of-concept studies are needed; 2) integrating engineering principles in methodologically rigorous research may help science keep pace with technology; 3) studies are needed that identify implementation issues; 4) inclusivity of people with a lived experience of a mental health condition can offer valuable perspectives and new insights; and 5) formation of a workgroup specific for digital geriatric mental health to set standards and principles for research and practice. We propose prioritizing the advancement of digital geriatric mental health research in several areas that are of great public health significance, including 1) simultaneous and integrated treatment of physical health and mental health conditions; 2) effectiveness studies that explore diagnostics and treatment of social determinants of health such as \"social isolation\" and \"loneliness;\" and 3) tailoring the development and testing of innovative strategies to minority older adult populations.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Particle dissolution process refers to the dissolving of one liquid or solid phase into another solvent phase. This process is of vital importance in the engineering material science, and chemical engineering, etc. Here, we develop a phase-field model with diffusion-controlled processes at interfaces for isothermal dissolution of alumina inclusion particles in molten silicates, referred as \"slag,\" with comprehensive compositions applied in process metallurgy. The interfacial energy between solid inclusion particle and molten silicate can vary with different temperatures and chemical compositions. This model is validated using experimental data of high-temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy (HT-CLSM) technique. Moreover, the developed model is applicable to predict the dissolution behavior of solid particle in a realistic size scale. The possibility of the model application is illustrated with studies of different physical parameters that affect particle dissolution behavior. The phase-field simulations show that inclusion morphology influences both the dissolution profile and time, and the influence decreases with the increased temperature. Increasing same amount of Al2O3 component in slag, the increased degrees of the alumina dissolution time in silicates with different V-ratio values, a ratio between the mass percent of CaO and that of SiO2, are almost the same. If the V-ratio of slag is relatively small, an increased MgO component in the silicate will significantly decrease the particle dissolution time. On the contrary, the change in MgO component in the silicate will have a minor effect if the value of V-ratio is quite large. In order to rapidly dissolve the inclusion, basicity index (BI) of molten silicate should be larger than 1.4. A balance between BI and MgO component in slag is suggested to be considered to design or optimize molten silicate (slag) for its application in the refining process of steel manufacturing.",

The primary objective of this study is to examine healthcare-related websites in nine European countries in order to evaluate the status of their accessibility. Such a detailed statistical comparison has not yet been made in Europe, especially as the present study offers a dual measurement system combining both the application of automated testing software and statistical analysis of user feedback. The study compares 48 websites from Eastern Europe with 51 sites from Western and Northern Europe. The research phase was performed in three steps: firstly by using AChecker, secondly by Nibbler and subsequently followed by user feedback questionnaires evaluated by a group of experts. The overall goal of this study is to determine the most common accessibility problems and to draw site owners' attention to shortcomings so that they can improve the quality of service of their healthcare-related sites in the future. The investigated European websites are grouped into Eastern and Western-Northern countries. We compared our results from different perspectives and ascertained that no significant differences can be established between the two groups predicated on their respective economic situations. Equally, no correlations were observed while comparing the sizes of web pages in Kbytes, the number of barriers and their Nibbler accessibility scores. Furthermore, there appears to be no correlation between the results of the software tests and the percentage of the elderly population in the respective country.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Density functional calculations with a plane-wave basis set are widely used in materials science. Due to recent developments in high-performance computers, the number of nodes equipped in such computers greatly exceeds the number of atoms included in a typical simulation. Thus, it is becoming difficult to perform calculations efficiently even when only a portion of all nodes are used (e.g., 10%). We have developed a multi-axis decomposition scheme in which both G-vectors and band axes are decomposed and 3D-FFT communicators are folded compactly. This proposed scheme retains the inner-most do-loop lengths sufficiently long and restrains the increased MPI communication costs as the number of nodes increases. In an investigation of a wide-gap semiconductor material (SiC), our PHASE/0 DFT code exhibits efficient and strong scaling (up to 82,944 nodes) even for a relatively small system with 3848 atoms, and demonstrates maximum peak performance of 2.25 PFLOPS for a 25,200-atom system despite employing 3D-FFT.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "We explore the contention that the seminal US National Academies consensus report, How People Learn (HPL), played a major role in bridging the flow of knowledge from Cognitive Science to Education. Our paper yielded four important results: First, HPL is, on a number of bibliometric measures, an unusually interdisciplinary work. Focusing on the fields of particular interest here, our citation analysis shows the Education, Cognitive Science, and Border field (e.g., Educational Psychology, Learning Sciences, and Learning Technology and Human-Computer Interaction) literatures all to have been major influences on it. Second, we found HPL to be unusually highly cited - and by publications from an unusually diverse set of disciplines. Beyond Education, Cognitive Science, and Border field publications, HPL was also relatively highly cited by publications in Medical/Healthrelated, Engineering, and other Discipline-Based Education Research fields. Third, undermining the claim that HPL served as a gateway to the Cognitive Science literature, we found Education articles citing HPL not to be more likely to have Cognitive Science as a major influence than are Education articles more generally, as indicated by their cited references. Finally, the Education publications that cited HPL were far more likely to refer to concepts in HPL that were already prevalent in the Education literature rather than to concepts from Cognitive Science. Conversely, the Cognitive Science publications that cited HPL were more apt to refer to concepts already in the Cognitive Science literature. Taken together, these results are a caution that, even for a highly regarded multidisciplinary work cited widely by publications from multiple disciplines, its direct influence could be largely disciplinary. Implications for the policy goals of fostering interdisciplinary research and the role of National Academies consensus reports are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Because the millennial generation is the largest generation in the U.S. labor force and is the most computer-literate generation, many organizations are investing in online methods for their training. From a recruitment perspective, applicants can use training information to form attitudes about an organization, such as their attraction. Yet, research has not examined whether organizational attraction is influenced by the type of training method an organization offers. Using two experiments, the purpose of the current article was to examine organizational attraction as a function of whether a training program is described as online or on-the-job, and pretraining satisfaction and perceived utility as mediators of this relationship. Study 1 used a two-group (online and on-the-job) between-subjects experimental design. Study 2 used a three-group (online, on-the-job, and combined online and on-the-job training) between-subjects experimental design to replicate Study 1 and add an additional condition: combining online and on-the-job methods. Participants were instructed to read a hotel's recruitment information for a front office position and evaluate the hotel assuming the role of an applicant. Participants had higher organizational attraction when training was described as on-the-job training than as online training. The effect of training method on organizational attraction was mediated by training satisfaction and utility. The most important theoretical contribution of the current studies is that the results contradict the general stereotypes and expectations of millennials. The results contribute to understanding how prospective applicants use organizational characteristics, such as the type of training they offer, to form attitudes, such as organizational attraction.",

            "abstract": "Learning how to name chemical compounds is a critical feature of chemistry that many students often find challenging. Naming compounds requires both an understanding of the conventions and language of chemistry. Common strategies used to improve student understanding of chemical nomenclature include study guides and games. However, little is known about how these strategies impact student learning of chemical nomenclature. This mixed-method study compares the effect of a new electronic chemistry game, Topinomica, versus an existing study guide on the learning of nomenclature in an introductory undergraduate chemistry course for a diverse student population (n = 470). Research methods include pre/post-tests, short student surveys and instructor questionnaires, and classroom observations. Quantitative findings indicate significant pre/post gains for both conditions, but no significant difference between the game (n = 255) and the study guide (n = 215). Prior knowledge analysis shows a significant difference between conditions for high prior knowledge students, with the game treatment performing better. Qualitative findings demonstrate that instructors endorse and are adopting the game and that students prefer a game to a study guide. We discuss implications of this research for future science education studies related to study guides and educational games.",

In addition to the overall effectiveness of the game, we investigated the impact of a specific game feature-constraints on the number of blocks in a solution. Results showed that after playing Penguin Go for less than two hours, students' CT skills improved significantly, but the additional constraints did not generate a significant impact on learning. In addition, the game overall did not influence students' attitudes toward computer science, but the constraints condition of the game negatively influenced students' attitudes toward computer science.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Meanings of risk in criminal justice assessment continue to evolve, making it critical to understand how particular compositions of risk are mediated, resisted and re-configured by experts and practitioners. Criminal justice organizations are working with computer scientists, software engineers and private companies that are skilled in big data analytics to produce new ways of thinking about and managing risk. Little is known, however, about how criminal justice systems, social justice organizations and individuals are shaping, challenging and redefining conventional actuarial risk episteme(s) through the use of big data technologies. The use of such analytics is shifting organizational risk practices, challenging social science methods of assessing risk, producing new knowledge about risk and consequently new forms of algorithmic governance. This article explores how big data reconfigure risk by producing a new form of algorithmic risk-a form of risk which is posited as different from the social science (psychologically) informed risk techniques already in use in many justice sectors. It also shows that new experts are entering the risk game, including technologists who make data public and accessible to a range of stakeholders. Finally, it demonstrates that big data analytics can be used to produce forms of usable knowledge that constitute types of 'information activism'. This form of activism produces alternative risk narratives, which are focused on 'criminogenic structures' or 'criminogenic policy'.",

            "abstract": "Human communication has evolved over the last decades thanks to rapid technological advances. It has provided us with new ways of communicating with one another and made many aspects of social interaction easier. Social computing is an important area in computer science concerned with the use of computational systems for social purposes. This paper focuses on the use of social computing to simplify the process of currency exchange at airports where services have to be provided to people of all nationalities. This is a complex social scenario in which the buyer and seller must reach an agreement without speaking the same language, and in these cases, the probability of not understanding all the aspects of the transaction is high. The proposed system improves interaction between users and ensures a fast and secure operation. A multi-agent system is the base of the developed software; MAS is an important and commonly used tool in social computing. A case study was conducted with the proposed system at Sydney airport, with a Spanish currency exchange company (Global Exchange) which provides service to travelers from all continents. The Net Promoter Score metric was used to evaluate the developed system, and a score of 29.81 was obtained, indicating that customers were highly satisfied with the performance of the system. Moreover, thanks to the system, there was an increase of 34% in currency exchange operations, and the time it takes to provide service to a customer reduced by 73.67% on average.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Time series classification has been considered as one of the most challenging problems in data mining and widely used in a broad range of fields, such as climate, finance, medicine and computer science. The main challenges of time series classification are to select the appropriate representation (feature extraction) of time series and choose the similarity metric between time series. Compared with the traditional feature extraction method, in this paper, we focus on the fusion of global features, local features and the interaction between them, while preserving the temporal information of the local features. Based on this strategy, a highly comparative approach to univariate time series classification is introduced that uses covariance matrices as interpretable features. From the perspective of probability theory, each covariance matrix can be seen as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Our idea is to incorporate covariance matrix into the framework of information geometry, which is to study the geometric structures on the manifolds of the probability distributions. The space of covariance matrices is a statistical (Riemannian) manifold and the geodesic distance is introduced to measure the similarity between them. Our method is to project each distribution (covariance matrix) to a vector on the tangent space of the statistical manifold. Finally, the classification is carried out in the tangent space which is a Euclidean space. Concepts of a structural and functional network are also presented which provide us an understanding of the properties of the data set and guide further interpretation to the classifier. Experimental evaluation shows that the performance of the proposed approach exceeded some competitive methods on benchmark datasets from the UCR time series repository. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Hybrid simulation (defined as a modelling approach that combines two or more of the following methods: discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and agent-based simulation) has experienced near exponential growth in popularity in the past two decades. However, a large proportion of the academic literature on hybrid simulation is found in computer science and engineering journals. Given the importance of this emerging area and its relevance to operational research, this paper provides a review of the topic from an OR perspective. The results of a review of the hybrid simulation literature are presented, using a novel framework based on the simulation lifecycle that will be useful for future modellers and authors alike. Promising areas for future research are identified: these include the development of new methods for conceptual modelling and for model validation. Currently the main application areas are healthcare, supply chain management and manufacturing, and the majority of published models combine discrete-event simulation and system dynamics.

            "abstract": "Polynomial reduction is one of the main tools in computational algebra with innumerable applications in many areas, both pure and applied. Since many years both the theory and an efficient design of the related algorithm have been solidly established. This paper presents a definition of the generic concept of polynomial reduction structure, studies its features and highlights the aspects needed in order to grant and to efficiently test the main properties (Noetherianity, confluence, ideal membership). The most significant aspect of this analysis is a negative reappraisal of the role of the notion of term ordering which is usually considered a central and crucial tool in the theory. In fact, as it was already established in the computer science context in relation with termination of algorithms, most of the properties can be obtained simply considering a well founded order, while the classical requirement that it be preserved by multiplication is irrelevant. The last part of the paper shows how the polynomial basis concepts present in literature are interpreted in our language and their properties are consequences of the general results established in the first part of the paper.

In the literature, there are two sensitivities to measure the complexity of a Boolean function. One is average sensitivity, the other one is maximal sensitivity. We follow the tradition and omit the word \"maximal\". In other words, in this paper, sensitivity is always maximal sensitivity. Using the past work of the authors and their coauthors on a characterization of NCF, we obtain the formula of the sensitivity of any NCF. We find that the sensitivity of any NCF is between inverted right perpendicularn+2/2inverted left perpendicular and n. Both lower and upper bounds are tight. We prove that the block sensitivity, hence the l-block sensitivity, is the same as the sensitivity for NCF. It is well known that monotone Boolean functions (MBF) also have this property. We characterize all functions which are both monotone and nested canalizing (MNCF). The closed formula of the cardinality of the set of MNCF5 is also provided. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: The use of conversational agent interventions in mental health is growing at a fast pace. Recent existing reviews have focused exclusively on a subset of embodied conversational agent interventions despite other modalities aiming to achieve the common goal of improved mental health. Objective: This study aimed to review the use of conversational agent interventions in the treatment of mental health problems. Methods: We performed a systematic search using relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane library). Studies that reported on an autonomous conversational agent that simulated conversation and reported on a mental health outcome were included. Results: A total of 13 studies were included in the review. Among them, 4 full-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The rest were feasibility, pilot RCTs and quasi-experimental studies. Interventions were diverse in design and targeted a range of mental health problems using a wide variety of therapeutic orientations. All included studies reported reductions in psychological distress postintervention. Furthermore, 5 controlled studies demonstrated significant reductions in psychological distress compared with inactive control groups. In addition, 3 controlled studies comparing interventions with active control groups failed to demonstrate superior effects. Broader utility in promoting well-being in nonclinical populations was unclear. Conclusions: The efficacy and acceptability of conversational agent interventions for mental health problems are promising. However, a more robust experimental design is required to demonstrate efficacy and efficiency. A focus on streamlining interventions, demonstrating equivalence to other treatment modalities, and elucidating mechanisms of action has the potential to increase acceptance by users and clinicians and maximize reach.",

            "abstract": "What is the significance of high-speed computation for the sciences? How far does it result in a practice of simulation which affects the sciences on a very basic level? To offer more historical context to these recurring questions, this paper revisits the roots of computer simulation in the development of the ENIAC computer and the Monte Carlo method. With the aim of identifying more clearly what really changed (or not) in the history of science in the 1940s and 1950s due to the computer, I will emphasize the continuities with older practices and develop a two-fold argument. Firstly, one can find a diversity of practices around ENIAC which tends to be ignored if one focuses only on the ENIAC itself as the originator of Monte Carlo simulation. Following from this, I claim, secondly, that there was no simulation around ENIAC. Not only is the term 'simulation' not used within that context, but the analysis also shows how 'simulation' is an effect of three interrelated sets of different practices around the machine: (1) the mathematics which the ENIAC users employed and developed, (2) the programs, (3) the physicality of the machine. I conclude that, in the context discussed, the most important shifts in practice are about rethinking existing computational methods. This was done in view of adapting them to the high-speed and programmability of the new machine. Simulation then is but one facet of this process of adaptation, singled out by posterity to be viewed as its principal aspect.",

Linear features present akey weakness to traditional routing calculations along cost surfaces because they cannot identify whether moving from acell to its adjacent neighbors constitutes crossing alinear barrier (increased cost) or following acorridor (reduced cost). Following and avoiding linear features can drastically change predicted routes. We introduce an approach to address this adjacency issue using asearch kernel that identifies these critical barriers and corridors.

We compare?CostMAP?performance with traditional cost surface approaches and show significant performance gains? both following corridors and avoiding barriers? by modeling the movement of alarge terrestrial animal? the Baird?s Tapir (Tapirus bairdii)? in amovement ecology framework and by modeling pipeline routing for carbon capture and storage (CCS).",

            "abstract": "This paper presents findings from a two-year qualitative study examining integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into elementary mathematics instruction. Integrated units were developed by elementary teachers and CS/CT coaches with support from university faculty with expertise in CS/CT and elementary mathematics. CS/CT instruction primarily relied on the Scratch environment, although some lessons made use of Code.org materials. This research primarily relied on two theories of integration (i.e. Kiray, 2012. A new model for the integration of science and mathematics: The balance model. Energy Education Science and Technology Part B: Social and Educational Studies, 4(3), 1181?1196) that provided insight into the level of interconnection between the disciplines and the relative amount of instructional time spent within each discipline. Findings revealed that cross-grade CS/CT concepts included sequencing, looping, and conditional logic. Within each category: (a) concepts were taught with increasing complexity across the grades, (b) the mathematics was dominant and CS/CT was important but secondary, and (c) three types of lessons emerged: No integration, partial integration, and full integration. Lastly, lessons generally included a transition from less integrated to more integrated activities with an initial focus on discipline-specific conceptual understanding prior to integrated activities.",

The question becomes whether this matters, and if it does, what should cognitive scientists do about it? I propose that the multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity of cognitive science does matter because it leads to potential generation of new ideas, models, and methods. I offer a few recommendations for reforming cognitive science based, in part, on the recent 41st annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society that sought to reopen cognitive science to minority disciplines comprising cognitive science.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background Cell tracking experiments, based on time-lapse microscopy, have become an important tool in biomedical research. The goal is the reconstruction of cell migration patterns, shape and state changes, and, comprehensive genealogical information from these data. This information can be used to develop process models of cellular dynamics. However, so far there has been no structured, standardized way of annotating and storing the tracking results, which is critical for comparative analysis and data integration. The key requirement to be satisfied by an ontology is the representation of a cell's change over time. Unfortunately, popular ontology languages, such as Web Ontology Language (OWL), have limitations for the representation of temporal information. The current paper addresses the fundamental problem of modeling changes of qualities over time in biomedical ontologies specified in OWL. Results The presented analysis is a result of the lessons learned during the development of an ontology, intended for the annotation of cell tracking experiments. We present, discuss and evaluate various representation patterns for specifying cell changes in time. In particular, we discuss two patterns of temporally changing information: n-ary relation reification and 4d fluents. These representation schemes are formalized within the ontology language OWL and are aimed at the support for annotation of cell tracking experiments. We analyze the performance of each pattern with respect to standard criteria used in software engineering and data modeling, i.e. simplicity, scalability, extensibility and adequacy. We further discuss benefits, drawbacks, and the underlying design choices of each approach. Conclusions We demonstrate that patterns perform differently depending on the temporal distribution of modeled information. The optimal model can be constructed by combining two competitive approaches. Thus, we demonstrate that both reification and 4d fluents patterns can work hand in hand in a single ontology. Additionally, we have found that 4d fluents can be reconstructed by two patterns well known in the computer science community, i.e. state modeling and actor-role pattern.",

            "abstract": "This is a COSPAR roadmap to advance the frontiers of science through innovation and international collaboration using small satellites. The world of small satellites is evolving quickly and an opportunity exists to leverage these developments to make scientific progress. In particular, the increasing availability of low-cost launch and commercially available hardware provides an opportunity to reduce the overall cost of science missions. This in turn should increase flight rates and encourage scientists to propose more innovative concepts, leading to scientific breakthroughs. Moreover, new computer technologies and methods are changing the way data are acquired, managed, and processed. The large data sets enabled by small satellites will require a new paradigm for scientific data analysis. In this roadmap we provide several examples of long-term scientific visions that could be enabled by the small satellite revolution. For the purpose of this report, the term \"small satellite\" is somewhat arbitrarily defined as a spacecraft with an upper mass limit in the range of a few hundred kilograms. The mass limit is less important than the processes used to build and launch these satellites. The goal of this roadmap is to encourage the space science community to leverage developments in the small satellite industry in order to increase flight rates, and change the way small science satellites are built and managed. Five recommendations are made; one each to the science community, to space industry, to space agencies, to policy makers, and finally, to COSPAR. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The field of computer science is witnessing the development of new and advanced applications in agricultural science and related technologies. Accurate evaluations of the ripeness of fruits and vegetables are very important in agricultural science as fruit growers can profit from the automatic detection and interpretation of fruit maturity levels. In this study, we propose a method of classifying Lycopersicons based on three maturity levels (immature, semi-mature, and mature). Our method includes two artificial neural networks, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a backpropagation neural network with a Softmax layer. A CAE involves the convergence of convolutional neural networks and an autoencoder and has recently gained considerable attention in the field of Engineering. However, a traditional backpropagation neural network also plays an important role in the proposed method. To adapt the classification system to various complex scenarios, the CAE functions as a background filter, and it determines the region of interest (ROI) in an image. A contribution of dais study is the use of a CAE to determine the ROI in the Lycopersicon image instead of tuning handcrafted parameters manually to set the ROI. The machine detects the Lycopersicon through self-learning mechanisms. Using the extracted features, the machine employs self-learning mechanisms to determine Lycopersicon maturity. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can recognize maturity levels with an accuracy rate of 100%. Therefore, the proposed algorithm provides objective and useful information concerning maturity to optimize the harvest time of Lycopersicons.",

            "abstract": "The availability of large image data sets has been a crucial factor in the success of deep learning-based classification and detection methods. Yet, while data sets for everyday objects are widely available, data for specific industrial use-cases (e.g., identifying packaged products in a warehouse) remains scarce. In such cases, the data sets have to be created from scratch, placing a crucial bottleneck on the deployment of deep learning techniques in industrial applications. We present work carried out in collaboration with a leading UK online supermarket, with the aim of creating a computer vision system capable of detecting and identifying unique supermarket products in a warehouse setting. To this end, we demonstrate a framework for using data synthesis to create an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, beginning with real-world objects and culminating in a trained model. Our method is based on the generation of a synthetic dataset from 3D models obtained by applying photogrammetry techniques to real-world objects. Using 100K synthetic images for 10 classes, an InceptionV3 convolutional neural network was trained, which achieved accuracy of 96% on a separately acquired test set of real supermarket product images. The image generation process supports automatic pixel annotation. This eliminates the prohibitively expensive manual annotation typically required for detection tasks. Based on this readily available data, a one-stage RetinaNet detector was trained on the synthetic, annotated images to produce a detector that can accurately localize and classify the specimen products in real-time.",

            "abstract": "Background: Emerging research suggests that increasing physical activity can help improve cognition among breast cancer survivors. However, little is known about the mechanism through which physical activity impacts cancer survivors' cognition. Objective: The objective of this secondary analysis examined physical and psychological function potentially linking physical activity with changes in cognition among breast cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial where the exercise arm had greater improvements in cognition than the control arm. Methods: A total of 87 sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 12-week physical activity intervention (n=43) or control condition (n=44). Objectively measured processing speed (National Institutes of Health Toolbox Oral Symbol Digit), self-reported cognition (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system [PROMIS] cognitive abilities), PROMIS measures of physical and psychological function (depression, anxiety, fatigue, and physical functioning), and plasma biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, homeostatic model assessment 2 of insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Linear mixed-effects models tested intervention effects on changes in physical and psychological function variables and biomarkers. Bootstrapping was used to assess mediation. Exploratory analyses examined self-reported cognitive abilities and processing speed as mediators of the intervention effect on physical functioning. Results: Participants in the exercise arm had significantly greater improvements in physical functioning (beta=1.23; 95% CI 2.42 to 0.03; P=.049) and reductions in anxiety (beta=-1.50; 95% CI -0.07 to -2.94; P=.04) than those in the control arm. Anxiety significantly mediated the intervention effect on cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -1.96 to -0.06), whereas physical functioning did not (bootstrap 95% CI -1.12 to 0.10). Neither anxiety (bootstrap 95% CI -1.18 to 0.74) nor physical functioning (bootstrap 95% CI -2.34 to 0.15) mediated the intervention effect on processing speed. Of the biomarkers, only CRP had greater changes in the exercise arm than the control arm (beta=.253; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.57; P=.09), but CRP was not associated with cognition; therefore, none of the biomarker measures mediated the intervention effect on cognition. Neither cognitive abilities (bootstrap 95% CI -0.06 to 0.68) nor processing speed (bootstrap 95% CI -0.15 to 0.63) mediated the intervention effect on physical function. Conclusions: Physical activity interventions may improve self-reported cognition by decreasing anxiety. If supported by larger studies, reducing anxiety may be an important target for improving self-reported cognition among cancer survivors.",

The Gaussian noise stability of a partition of R-n is simply the probability that two correlated Gaussian vectors both fall into the same part. In many applications, the goal is to find an optimizer of noise stability among all possible partitions of R-n to k parts with given Gaussian measures mu(1), . . . , mu(k). We call a partition epsilon-optimal, if its noise stability is optimal up to an additive s. In this paper, we give a computable function n(epsilon) such that an s-optimal partition exists in R-n(epsilon).

Our work investigates how proximity-based computing mediates children?s engagement in scientific sense-making conversations in a botanical garden. We draw upon sociocultural perspectives on sense-making talk as well as learning on-the-move to inform our study design. Data are from children in summer camp, including field notes, photographs, and video records (26 children in Case A, 24 in Case B) in an Arboretum. Our findings illustrate that children engaged in both playful and scientific sense-making talk in two distinct curricular tasks. We provide insights into science sense-making talk patterns and pedagogical practices of integrating learning on-the-move strategies into informal education with design principles related to augmenting gardens with digital content. Our results suggest that learning on-the-move strategies influence sense-making talk and that embodied interactions within the gardens support science sense-making and role-play. We posit that designs for learner-centered mobile computing can create digital-physical hybrid spaces where learners engage each other and natural objects as they walk through community spaces.",

            "abstract": "In this issue, Cantor and colleagues synthesize a broad representation of the literature on the science of learning, and how learning changes over the course of development. Their perspective highlights three important factors about the emerging field of science of learning and development: (1) that it draws insights from increasingly diverse fields of research inquiry, from neuroscience and social science to computer science and adversity science; (2) that it provides a means to understand principles that generalize across learners, and yet also allow individual differences in learning to emerge and inform; and (3) that it recognizes that learning occurs in context, and is thus a shared responsibility between the learner, the instructor, and the environment. Here I discuss how this complex systems dynamical perspective can be integrated with the emerging framework of ?learning engineering? to provide a blueprint for significant innovations in education.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The availability and quantity of remotely sensed and terrestrial geospatial data sets are on the rise. Historically, these data sets have been analyzed and quarried on 2D desktop computers; however, immersive technologies and specifically immersive virtual reality (iVR) allow for the integration, visualization, analysis, and exploration of these 3D geospatial data sets. iVR can deliver remote and large-scale geospatial data sets to the laboratory, providing embodied experiences of field sites across the earth and beyond. We describe a workflow for the ingestion of geospatial data sets and the development of an iVR workbench, and present the application of these for an experience of Iceland's Thrihnukar volcano where we: (1) combined satellite imagery with terrain elevation data to create a basic reconstruction of the physical site; (2) used terrestrial LiDAR data to provide a geo-referenced point cloud model of the magmatic-volcanic system, as well as the LiDAR intensity values for the identification of rock types; and (3) used Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to construct a photorealistic point cloud of the inside volcano. The workbench provides tools for the direct manipulation of the georeferenced data sets, including scaling, rotation, and translation, and a suite of geometric measurement tools, including length, area, and volume. Future developments will be inspired by an ongoing user study that formally evaluates the workbench's mature components in the context of fieldwork and analyses activities.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Machine simulation of human reading has caught the attention of computer science researchers since the introduction of digital computers. Character recognition is the process of recognizing either printed or handwritten text from document images and converting it into machine-readable form. Character recognition is successfully implemented for various foreign language scripts like English, Chinese and Latin. In the case of Indian language scripts, the character recognition process is comparatively difficult due to the complex nature of scripts. MODI script - an ancient Indian script, is the shorthand form for the Devanagari script in which Marathi was written. Though at present, the script is not used officially, it has historical importance. MODI character recognition is a very complex task due to its variations in the writing style of individuals, shape similarity of characters and the absence of word stopping symbol in documents. The advances in various machine learning techniques have greatly contributed to the success of various character recognition processes. The proposed work provides an overview of various feature extraction and classification techniques used in the recognition of MODI script till date and also provides evaluation and comparison of these techniques.",

While building his machines, he also started to devise a conceptual and notational system for writing 'programs' to execute applications much more complex than the basic arithmetic calculations. He delved deep into the study of formal logic in order to work out his \"computation plan\", the Plankalkul. Although the Plan Calculus didn't exercise much impact on German post-World War hardships, it displays all the traits currently recognized as standard features of modern programming languages. The aim of the present study is to highlight the general purpose and technical specifics of this language, its historical and scientific background, and the philosophical inspiration leading Konrad Zuse to employ the predicate logic in the formalization of the \"computation projects\" for his machines.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "This work seeks to solve one of the basic problems in chemistry learning: understanding the chemical bond as a dynamic equilibrium between attractive and repulsive forces. This force-based model is difficult to grasp, as there are no analogues from everyday life for both attractions and repulsions happening simultaneously. In addition, current teaching approaches often mislead by using mainly the 'octet rule' heuristic. As a result, students construct naive models of the chemical bond, usually viewing atoms as solid balls that are attached to each other in order to \"achieve an octet.\" To represent the force-based dynamics of the bond, we designed the ELI-Chem learning environment. This environment enables interaction as an atom with another atom while observing the underlying forces and the potential energy curve. Our theoretical framework is based on Embodied Learning theory by relating conceptual learning to bodily experiences. The study uses qualitative and quantitative methods with 21 high school chemistry students in a pretest-intervention-posttest design. During a 40 minute activity with the ELI-Chem simulation, students were prompted to discover the underlying forces of bonding and relate them to energy changes. Findings show that learning with the ELI-Chem simulation supports students in gaining the knowledge elements that are required to build the dynamic force-based mental model of chemical bonding, and to conceptualize chemical energy as due to forces. Finally, the design principles of the ELI-Chem environment are discussed. Aligned with science standards, attending to students' difficulties, and using the advantages of a computer simulation, the ELI-Chem environment provides an appropriate representation of chemical bonding, which is more valid scientifically yet makes the abstract concept accessible.",

            "abstract": "Despite the advancements in the production and accessibility of videos and animations, a gap exists between their potential for science teaching and their actual use in the classroom. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an approach to boost chemistry and biology teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and their confidence regarding the use of videos and animations in class, which are required for their effective implementation. Twelve experienced high-school chemistry and biology teachers participated in a professional development workshop including biochemistry and technological-pedagogical lectures along with video-editing instruction and practice. Teachers were provided with digital videos including high-resolution scientifically based animations and were encouraged to edit them based on their pedagogical experience and the needs of their class. We investigated how the workshop affected teachers' TPACK-confidence and TPACK. TPACK-confidence was assessed by pre- and post-workshop questionnaires and open-ended feedback questionnaires. TPACK was assessed by analyses of the edited digital videos and pedagogical considerations submitted by the teachers. It was found that teachers' TPACK-confidence was significantly higher following the workshop. There was also a development in the teachers' TPACK. They were able to recommend to use digital videos in a variety of classroom situations based on the technological pedagogical knowledge (e.g., as an opening to a new topic) and their TPACK (e.g., to visualize complex biochemical processes). We also found a development in their video-editing skills and their knowledge of how to use this technology effectively in biochemistry lessons. Results indicate that training teachers in using technological tools while providing them with relevant Content Knowledge and TPACK, and relying on their pre-existing Pedagogical Content Knowledge may assist them develop their TPACK and TPACK-confidence. This may promote the effective use of videos and animations in biochemistry teaching.",

Helping students navigate the three levels of representation; macroscopic, particulate and symbolic is a potential use of this time. This study looked at two different types of visualization for an electrochemistry laboratory in second semester general chemistry and the impact that the visualization type had on the student discourse. Macroscopic visualization (MV) was accomplished through a traditional hands-on laboratory and particulate visualization (PV) was achieved using a computer simulation featuring animated electrons and ions. The type of visualization impacted how much the students talked, who they talked to, and what they talked about. The MV students engaged in less peer-to-peer discussion than the PV students. The MV students expressed more excitement about their observations and were more focused on getting the data quickly. The MV spent most of their time physically doing the laboratory work while spending little time discussing the concepts. The PV students spent more time talking about concepts with their peers especially at the particulate level even answering macroscopic questions with particulate explanations. The type of visualization influenced all aspects of the student discourse.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, the network data that we need to deal with and make sense of are becoming increasingly large and complex. Small-world networks are a type of complex networks whose underling graphs have small diameter, shorter average path length between nodes, and a high degree of clustering structures and can be found in a wide range of scientific fields, including social networks, sociology, computer science, business intelligence, and biology. However, conventional visualization algorithms for small-work networks lead to a uniform clump of nodes or are restricted to a tree structure, making the network structure difficult to identify and analyze. This work provides a new visual analytical method to improve the situation. Different from previous methods based on spanning trees, this method first generates a weighted planar sub-network based on the measurement of network centrality metrics. A force-directed algorithm based on node-edge repulsion is then applied to visualize this sub-network into a proper layout for better understanding of the data. Finally, the remaining links are placed back to maintain the original network's integrity. The experimental results show that compared to previous methods, the proposed method can be more effective in differentiating clusters and revealing relationship patterns among individual nodes and clusters in the network. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a data of the semiconductor wafer manufacturing industry as a case study. The work shows that this new approach allows users to gain useful insights into the data.",

This method is termed remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and can be achieved with consumer-level cameras (e.g., a webcam or mobile camera). The goal of the present publication is two-fold. First, we aim to organize future rPPG software developments in a tractable and nontechnical manner, such that the public gains access to a basic open-source rPPG code, comes to understand its utility, and can follow its most recent progressions. The second goal is to investigate rPPG's accuracy in detecting heart rates from the skin surfaces of several body parts after physical exercise and under ambient lighting conditions with a consumer-level camera. We report that rPPG is highly accurate when the camera is aimed at facial skin tissue, but that the heart rate recordings from wrist regions are less reliable, and recordings from the calves are unreliable. Facial rPPG remained accurate despite the high heart rates after exercise. The proposed research procedures and the experimental findings provide guidelines for future studies on rPPG.",

            "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) have become the dominant models of rapid decision-making. Several variants of these models have been proposed, ranging from the simple linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to the more complex leaky-competing accumulator (LCA), and further extensions that include time-varying rates of evidence accumulation or decision thresholds. Although applications of the simpler variants have been widespread, applications of the more complex models have been fewer, largely due to their intractable likelihood function and the computational cost of mass simulation. Here, I present a framework for efficiently fitting complex EAMs, which uses a new, efficient method of simulating these models. I find that the majority of simulation time is taken up by random number generation (RNG) from the normal distribution, needed for the stochastic noise of the differential equation. To reduce this inefficiency, I propose using the well-known concept within computer science of \"look-up tables\" (LUTs) as an approximation to the inverse cumulative density function (iCDF) method of RNG, which I call \"LUT-iCDF\". I show that when using an appropriately sized LUT, simulations using LUT-iCDF closely match those from the standard RNG method in R. My framework, which I provide a detailed tutorial on how to implement, includes C code for 12 different variants of EAMs using the LUT-iCDF method, and should make the implementation of complex EAMs easier and faster.",

If the response is binary there is a mixture of Bernoulli distributions, which has practical applications for the classification of texts and images, biochemistry, genetics, robotics, computer science or pattern recognition. A finite mixture of probability distributions includes a set of parameters such as the proportion of the mixture and the parameters of each distribution. This simple case allows us to make some explicit computations of the estimators as well as working on the EM algorithm doing some comparisons. Some of these parameters may depend on one or more covariates through some specific model. Mixtures of exponential family distributions, except in very particular cases, are no longer within the exponential family and this means, among other things, that the expectation for computing the Information Matrix must, in most cases, be approximated. One of the main contributions of this article is its handling of this. Linear and logistic models are considered either for the proportion of one of the two populations (clusters), or for the parameters of the Bernoulli distributions.

            "abstract": "Dr Georgia Papaioannou, MD, PhD, Head of the Paediatric Radiology Department at 'Mitera' Children's Hospital in Athens (Greece), is one of the most talented Paediatric Radiologists in Greece. She graduated from the Medical School of Athens of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 1996 and she was trained in Radiology at the 2nd Department of Radiology of the Medical School of Athens and in Paediatric Radiology in Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) in London (UK). Her special interests focus on foetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and special applications of paediatric MRI, such as MR enterography and MR urography. According to Dr Papaioannou, medical education in Paediatric Radiology has to be of excellent quality, raising professional career and academic opportunities. Paediatric Radiology focuses on the diagnostic imaging of foetuses, neonates, infants, children and adolescents and represents the oldest subspecialty of Radiology. The advent in technology and computer science, which is strongly associated with Radiology, has launched a new era for Paediatric Radiology training and practice. Digital imaging and archiving, telemedicine, fused imaging, evolution of sonographic equipment, computed tomography (CT) and MRI scanners have opened new horizons to the understating of paediatric physiology and pathophysiology and have contributed significantly in precision Medicine and the implication of targeted therapies into clinical practice. Modern paediatric imaging focuses on radiation protection issues and launches faster sequences in all modalities, in order to reduce the number and duration of sedation. The diagnosis of neonatal and paediatric viral infections is routinely clinical and laboratory; however, Paediatric Radiology assists the diagnostic approach by excluding other entities, if that is required, i.e., in complex cases or hospitalized children, and mainly by revealing associated complications.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Engineering designs can involve multiple stages, where at each stage, the design models are incrementally modified and optimized. In contrast to traditional dynamic optimization problems, where the changes are caused by some objective factors, the changes in such incremental optimization problems (IOPs) are usually caused by the modifications made by the decision makers during the design process. While existing work in the literature is mainly focused on traditional dynamic optimization, little research has been dedicated to solving such IOPs. In this paper, we study how to adopt cooperative coevolution to efficiently solve a specific type of IOPs, namely, those with increasing decision variables. First, we present a benchmark function generator on the basis of some basic formulations of IOPs with increasing decision variables and exploitable modular structure. Then, we propose a contribution-based cooperative coevolutionary framework coupled with an incremental grouping method for dealing with them. On one hand, the benchmark function generator is capable of generating various benchmark functions with various characteristics. On the other hand, the proposed framework is promising in solving such problems in terms of both optimization accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, the proposed method is further assessed using a real-world application, i.e., the design optimization of a stepped cantilever beam.",

            "abstract": "The transformation of digital computers from bulky machines to portable systems has been enabled by new materials and advanced processing technologies that allow ultrahigh integration of solid-state electronic switching devices. As this conventional scaling pathway has approached atomic-scale dimensions, the constituent nanomaterials (such as SiO2 gate dielectrics, poly-Si floating gates and Co-Cr-Pt ferromagnetic alloys) increasingly possess properties that are dominated by quantum physics. In parallel, quantum information science has emerged as an alternative to conventional transistor technology, promising new paradigms in computation, communication and sensing. The convergence between quantum materials properties and prototype quantum devices is especially apparent in the field of 2D materials, which offer a broad range of materials properties, high flexibility in fabrication pathways and the ability to form artificial states of quantum matter. In this Review, we discuss the quantum properties and potential of 2D materials as solid-state platforms for quantum-dot qubits, single-photon emitters, superconducting qubits and topological quantum computing elements. By focusing on the interplay between quantum physics and materials science, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the use of 2D materials in the field of quantum information science.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In evolutionary biology, randomness has been perceived as a force that, in and of itself, is capable of inventing: mutation creates new genetic information at random across the genome which leads to phenotypic change, which is then subject to selection. However, in science in general and in computer science in particular, the widespread use of randomness takes a different form. Here, randomization allows for the breaking of pattern, as seen for example in its removal of biases (patterns) by random sampling or random assignment to conditions. Combined with various forms of evaluation, this breaking of pattern becomes an extraordinarily powerful tool, as also seen in many randomized algorithms in computer science. Here we show that this power of randomness is harnessed in nature by sex and recombination. In a finite population, and under the assumption of interactions between genetic variants, sex and recombination allow selection to test how well an allele will perform in a sample of combinations of interacting genetic partners drawn at random from all possible such combinations; consequently, even a small number of tests of genotypes such as takes place in a finite population favors alleles that will most likely perform well in a vast number of yet unrealized genetic combinations. This power of randomization is not manifest in asexual populations. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

However, the execution of complex chemical syntheses in itself requires expert knowledge, usually acquired over many years of study and hands-on laboratory practice. The development of technologies with potential to streamline and automate chemical synthesis is a half-century-old endeavour yet to be fulfilled. Renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven by improved computing power, data availability and algorithms, is overturning the limited success previously obtained. In this Review, we discuss the recent impact of AI on different tasks of synthetic chemistry and dissect selected examples from the literature. By examining the underlying concepts, we aim to demystify AI for bench chemists in order that they may embrace it as a tool rather than fear it as a competitor, spur future research by pinpointing the gaps in knowledge and delineate how chemical AI will run in the era of digital chemistry.",

            "abstract": "As a milestone research in vortex identification (VI), the physical quantity of Liutex, including its forms of scalar, vector and tensor, was systematically explored and rigorously obtained as the third-generation (3G) of the vortex definition and identification methods distinguished from the first generation (1G) by vorticity and the second generation (2G) by the vortex identification (VI) criteria solely dependent on the velocity gradient tensor eigenvalues. Based on these findings, the vortex-core lines were abstracted from the well-defined Liutex, and for the first time, were automatically generated and massively visualized using computer. The distinctive characteristics of these vortex cores with the intriguing threshold-independency make them be the uniquely appropriate entity to represent and to depict the vortex structures in turbulence. The letter made use of the DNS data for the natural transition in a zero-pressure gradient flat-plate (Type-A turbulent boundary layer (TBL)) and the fully-developed turbulence in a square annular duct (Type-B TBL) to demonstrate the vortex structure represented by the vortex-core lines. The 3G VI approach based on the vortex-core lines is capable of profoundly uncovering the vortex natures. Moreover, the capability of automatically identifying the vortex cores and massively visualizing the large number of vortex-core behaviors in a transient way will enable the fluid-mechanics and other related-science communities to step into a new era to explore the intrinsic natures of the centennial puzzle of turbulence and other vortex-related phenomena in future.",

            "abstract": "Remanufacturing is a critical enabler of a resource efficient manufacturing industry that has long been associated with high value products. Over time, the commercial relationship between customers and service providers has been made through the fulfilment of rights and obligations under remanufacturing service contracts. Nonetheless, financial analysis to evaluate the contract terms and conditions are becoming increasingly difficult to conduct due to complex decision problems inherent in remanufacturing systems. In order to achieve better and safer decision-making to shape the business strategies, remanufacturers often employ computer-based simulation tools to assess contractual obligations and customers' needs. This paper discusses the roles of a symbiotic simulation system (SSS) in supporting decision-making in remanufacturing systems. An industrial case study of power transformer remanufacturing illustrates how SSS can support contract remanufacturers in managing service contracts planning and execution. By linking the simulation model to the physical system, it has been demonstrated that the capabilities of the remanufacturers to make critical decisions throughout the entire service contract period can be extended.

The classical Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma implies that Tr(n,nr,k)=2k for k <= r. Although determining Tr(n,m,k) precisely for general k and m seems hopeless, estimating it remains a widely open problem with connections to important questions in computer science and combinatorics. For example, an influential result of Kahn-Kalai-Linial gives non-trivial bounds on Tr(n,m,k) for k=Theta(n) and m=Theta(2n). Here, we prove that, for r,alpha-1 <= no(1), it holds that Tr(n,nr,alpha n)=n mu(1+o(1)) with mu=r+1-log(1+alpha)2-log(1+alpha).Thus, we (essentially) determine Tr(n,m,k) for k=Theta(n) and all m up to 2no(1). For the proof, we establish a 'sparse' version of another classical result, the Kruskal-Katona Theorem, which gives a stronger guarantee when the hypergraph does not induce dense sub-hypergraphs. Furthermore, we prove that the parameters in our sparse Kruskal-Katona theorem are essentially best possible. Finally, we mention two simple applications which may be of independent interest.",

To improve radiologists' working efficiency, we developed a semi-automatic computer-aided diagnosis system to classify mammograms into normality and abnormality and thus to ease the process of making a diagnosis of breast cancer. Through transferring deep convolutional neural network DenseNet201 on the basis of suspicious regions provided by radiologists into our system, we obtained the network we termed DenseNet201-C, which achieved a high diagnostic accuracy of 92.73%. The comparison results between our method and the other five methods show that our method achieved the highest accuracy.",

            "abstract": "This review re-examines the use of accelerometer and oxygen uptake data for the assessment of activity intensity. Accelerometers capture mechanical work, while oxygen uptake captures the energy cost of this work. Frequency filtering needs to be considered when processing acceleration data. A too restrictive filter attenuates the acceleration signal for walking and, to a higher degree, for running. This measurement error affects shorter (children) more than taller (adults) individuals due to their higher movement frequency. Less restrictive filtering includes more movement-related signals and provides measures that better capture mechanical work, but may include more noise. An optimal filter cut-point is determined where most relevant acceleration signals are included. Further, accelerometer placement affects what part of mechanical work being captured. While the waist placement captures total mechanical work and therefore contributes to measures of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature, the thigh and wrist placements capture more internal work and do not provide equivalent measures. Value calibration of accelerometer measures is usually performed using measured oxygen uptake with the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) as reference measure of activity intensity. However, the use of MET is not stringent and is not a measure of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature. A candidate measure is the mass-specific net oxygen uptake, VO(2)net (VO(2)tot - VO(2)stand). To improve measurement of physical activity intensity using accelerometers, research developments are suggested concerning the processing of accelerometer data, use of energy expenditure as reference for activity intensity, and calibration procedure with absolute versus relative intensity.",

Significant improvements in the field of bioprinting have occurred over the last two decades. This reviews provides an in-depth analysis of recent improvements in the bioprinting techniques, progress in bio-ink development, implementation of new bioprinting and tissue maturation strategies. Special attention is givent to the role of polymer science and how it complements 3D bioprinting to overcome some of the major impediments in the field of organ printing. A concise overview of the anatomy and physiology of different tissues/organs is provided, followed by important design considerations to better facilitate the fabrication of biomimetic tissues/organs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). Last, a realistic overview of current status in organ bioprinting is presented, including recent accomplishments in bioprinting tissue-engineered constructs, the limitations and challenges, as well as opportunities for future research. We strongly believe that with the advances in polymer sciences, it will be an impending reality for on-demand bioprinting of patient-specific tissues/organs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstract": "Neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system. Developing a good modeling of human neurons is very important not only to neurobiology but also to computer science and many other fields. The McCulloch and Pitts neuron model is the most widely used neuron model, but has long been criticized as being oversimplified in view of properties of real neuron and the computations they perform. On the other hand, it has become widely accepted that dendrites play a key role in the overall computation performed by a neuron. However, the modeling of the dendritic computations and the assignment of the right synapses to the right dendrite remain open problems in the field. Here, we propose a novel dendritic neural model (DNM) that mimics the essence of known nonlinear interaction among inputs to the dendrites. In the model, each input is connected to branches through a distance-dependent nonlinear synapse, and each branch performs a simple multiplication on the inputs. The soma then sums the weighted products from all branches and produces the neuron's output signal. We show that the rich nonlinear dendritic response and the powerful nonlinear neural computational capability, as well as many known neurobiological phenomena of neurons and dendrites, may be understood and explained by the DNM. Furthermore, we show that the model is capable of learning and developing an internal structure, such as the location of synapses in the dendritic branch and the type of synapses, that is appropriate for a particular task - for example, the linearly nonseparable problem, a real-world benchmark problem - Glass classification and the directional selectivity problem.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The Kantorovich metric provides a way of measuring the distance between two Borel probability measures on a metric space. This metric has a broad range of applications from bioinformatics to image processing, and is commonly linked to the optimal transport problem in computer science (Deng and Du in Electron. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci. 253: 73-82, 2009; Villani in Optimal Transport: Old and New, Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, vol. 338, 2009). Noteworthy to this paper will be the role of the Kantorovich metric in the study of iterated function systems, which are families of contractive mappings on a complete metric space. When the underlying metric space is compact, it is well known that the space of Borel probability measures on this metric space, equipped with the Kantorovich metric, constitutes a compact, and thus complete metric space. In previous work, we generalized the Kantorovich metric to operator-valued measures for a compact underlying metric space, and applied this generalized metric to the setting of iterated function systems (Davison in Acta Appl. Math., 2014, 10.1007/s10440-014-9976-y; Generalizing the Kantorovich Metric to Projection-Valued Measures: With an Application to Iterated Function Systems, 2015; Acta Appl. Math., 2018, 10.1007/s10440-018-0161-6). We note that the work of P. Jorgensen, K. Shuman, and K. Kornelson provided the framework for our application to this setting (Jorgensen in Adv. Appl. Math. 34(3):561-590, 2005; Jorgenson et al. in J. Math. Phys. 48(8):083511, 2007; Jorgensen in Operator Theory, Operator Algebras, and Applications, Contemp. Math., vol. 414, pp. 13-26, 2006). The situation when the underlying metric space is complete, but not necessarily compact, has been studied by A. Kravchenko (Sib. Math. J. 47(1), 68-76, 2006). In this paper, we extend the results of Kravchenko to the generalized Kantorovich metric on operator-valued measures.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In this paper, a new method, named the Fragile Points Method (FPM), is developed for computer modeling in engineering and sciences. In the FPM, simple, local, polynomial, discontinuous and Point-based trial and test functions are proposed based on randomly scattered points in the problem domain. The local discontinuous polynomial trial and test functions are postulated by using the Generalized Finite Difference method. These functions are only piece-wise continuous over the global domain. By implementing the Point-based trial and test functions into the Galerkin weak form, we define the concept of Point Stiffnesses as the contribution of each Point in the problem domain to the global stiffness matrix. However, due to the discontinuity of trial and test functions in the domain, directly using the Galerkin weak form leads to inconsistency. To resolve this, Numerical Flux Corrections, which are frequently used in Discontinuous Galerkin methods are further employed in the FPM. The resulting global stiffness matrix is symmetric and sparse, which is advantageous for large-scale engineering computations. Several numerical examples of 1D and 2D Poisson equations are given in this paper to demonstrate the high accuracy, robustness and convergence of the FPM. Because of the locality and discontinuity of the Point-based trial and test functions, this method can be easily extended to model extreme problems in mechanics, such as fragility, rupture, fracture, damage, and fragmentation. These extreme problems will be discussed in our future studies.",

            "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among cancer-related death. Like other cancers, the finest solution for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment is early screening. Automatic CAD system of lung cancer screening from Computed Tomography scan mainly involves two steps: detect all suspicious pulmonary nodules and evaluate the malignancy of the nodules. Recently, there are many works about the first step, but rare about the second step. Since the presence of pulmonary nodules does not absolutely specify cancer, the morphology of nodules such as shape, size, and contextual information has a sophisticated relationship with cancer, the screening of lung cancer needs a careful investigation on each suspicious nodule and integration of information of all nodules. We propose deep CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision to solve this problem. First, the suspicious nodules are generated with the modified version of U-Net and then the generated nodules become an input data for our model. The proposed model is a multi-path CNN which exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously to automatically detect lung cancer. To this end, the model used three paths, each path employed different receptive field size which helps to model distant dependencies (short and long-range dependencies of the neighboring pixels). Then, to further upgrade our model performance, we concatenate features from the three paths. This balance the receptive field size effect and makes our model more adaptable to the variability of shape, size, and contextual information among nodules. Finally, we also introduce a retraining phase system that permits us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of image labels. Experimental results on Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 challenge shows that our model is better adaptable to the described inconsistency among nodules size and shape, and also obtained better detection results compared to the recently published state of the art methods.",

Scientific societies and science educators have responded to the gap between student skills and employer expectations by recommending that undergraduate STEM curricula focus on cross-disciplinary, workplace-related skills in addition to discipline-specific skills and content knowledge. This study examined the disciplinary cultures in which STEM faculty teach and STEM students learn. We developed and validated the Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U), which assesses the extent to which students value specific cross-disciplinary skills, as well as their experiences with teaching practices thought to reinforce such skills. We surveyed > 2000 students majoring in biological sciences, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science. We interviewed five students from each discipline to supplement survey data. Next, we surveyed faculty members (N = 147) within these disciplines regarding the extent to which they valued the same cross-disciplinary skills and how this influenced their teaching practices. Student values differed according to academic discipline, classroom experiences, and individual characteristics, such as prior research experience. We offer a conceptual framework by which the relationship between faculty values, faculty teaching practices, and student values can be studied. Specifically, it predicts that faculty values are embodied in their teaching practices, and student values are shaped by their classroom experiences, leading to transmission of disciplinary values from faculty to students. Future studies should examine these relationships across different disciplines and institution types.",

Possible self-interventions can help people imagine themselves having a successful future. Using social cognitive theory and expectancy-value framework, the current study explored virtual reality (VR; HTC Vive) as a space for a possible self-intervention to decrease stereotype threat and increase pSTEM motivation. Participants were 79 undergraduate women in California (46% Asian, 32% Latina, 14% white) who were randomly assigned to embody a future self either highly successful in pSTEM or highly successful in humanities. Following the virtual experience, women in the pSTEM condition differed significantly from women in the humanities condition regarding pSTEM value beliefs, anticipated stereotype threat, course motivation, and women-pSTEM implicit associations, after controlling for prior pSTEM-self implicit associations. However, this difference only occurred among women who identified with the experience. While women with high identification demonstrated an effect in the desired direction, women with low identification demonstrated reactance in the opposite direction. This speaks to the usefulness of identification as a moderator and implies that virtual reality might be a useful tool for future self-interventions among students.",

Data were collected from a survey conducted with 104 teachers from 40 districts in Utah (USA), considering their conceptions of teaching and learning, their conceptions of the nature of science, their feelings about technology, their competency in using technology, and frequency of classroom technology use. Results revealed the existence of strong correlations among many selected components of science teacher identity, and the identification of three clusters of teachers: Agree with constructivism-Disagree with instructivism teachers; Strongly agree with constructivism-Strongly disagree with instructivism teachers and Strongly agree with constructivism-Undecided about instructivism teachers. Finally, the practical implications of these results in terms of science teacher identity development are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Researchers, evaluators, and practitioners need tools to distinguish between applications of technology that support, enhance, and transform classroom instruction and those that are ineffective or even deleterious. Here we present a new classroom observation protocol designed specifically to capture the quality of technology use to support science inquiry in high school science classrooms. We iteratively developed and piloted the Technology Observation Protocol for Science (TOP-Science), building directly on our published framework for quality technology integration. Development included determining content and face validity, as well as the calculation of reliability estimates across a broad range of high school science classrooms. The resulting protocol focuses on the integration of technology in classrooms on three dimensions: science and engineering practices, student-centered teaching, and contextualization. It uses both quantitative coding and written descriptions of evidence for each code; both are synthesized in a multi-dimensional measure of quality. Data are collected and evaluated from the perspective of the teacher's intentions, actions, and reflections on these actions. This protocol fills an important gap in understanding technology's role in teaching and learning by doing more than monitoring technology's presence or absence, and considering its integration in the context of the Next Generation Science Standards science and engineering practices. Its applications include research, evaluation, and potentially peer evaluation.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The problem of knowledge evolution has received considerable attention over the years. Mainly, the study of the dynamics of knowledge has been addressed in the area of Belief Revision, a field emerging as the convergence of the efforts in Philosophy, Logic, and more recently Computer Science, where research efforts usually involve \"flat\" knowledge bases where there is no additional information about the formulas stored in it. Even when this may be a good fit for particular applications, in many real-world scenarios different information items may be attached to formulas. For instance, when the reliability of the source of the piece of information is attached to it as a measure of some quality (e.g., strength) of the piece of information itself, or when some characteristic informs us on the desirability of the item (e.g., the potential benefit that could be obtained from it). If this type of information is available, we can use it to guide how the belief base is to be modified when new information arrives. In this work, we present a novel approach to the contraction of knowledge bases where formulas have values attached that measure some quality linked to those formulas, exploiting it to define their desirability, and uses such desirability to define which formulas need to be removed to solve conflicts. In this context, we introduce a set of properties for contraction operators by extending classic approaches. We also show how the local treatment of minimal conflicts can induce some counter-intuitive contractions, and we present a way to avoid them by considering optimal resolutions of conflicts using the additional information encoded. We show how the proposed formalization captures any contraction that is optimal under a set of features. Finally, we present a refinement based on the identification of related minimal conflicts that performs contraction in optimal ways without looking into the entire knowledge base. The approach is based on the use of the accrual of beliefs where several formulas collaboratively use their respective values to prevail in the resolution of conflicts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstract": "Peer reviews, evaluations, and selections are a fundamental aspect of modern science. Funding bodies the world over employ experts to review and select the best proposals from those submitted for funding. The problem of peer selection, however, is much more general: a professional society may want to give a subset of its members awards based on the opinions of all members; an instructor for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) or an online course may want to crowdsource grading; or a marketing company may select ideas from group brainstorming sessions based on peer evaluation. We make three fundamental contributions to the study of peer selection, a specific type of group decision-making problem, studied in computer science, economics, and political science. First, we propose a novel mechanism that is strategyproof, i.e., agents cannot benefit by reporting insincere valuations. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism by a comprehensive simulation-based comparison with a suite of mechanisms found in the literature. Finally, our mechanism employs a randomized rounding technique that is of independent interest, as it solves the apportionment problem that arises in various settings where discrete resources such as parliamentary representation slots need to be divided proportionally.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "As an important technology of social network analysis, link prediction is widely applied in computer science and many other fields. Link prediction can be used to detect missing links or predict whether two unconnected nodes will connect in the future. Various link prediction approaches have been proposed based on similarity metrics or learning in recent years: however, most failed to consider the direct changes during network development, and hence they are not applied to dynamic networks whose structures change continuously over time. In this paper, a novel approach for link prediction in dynamic networks based on the attraction force between nodes (DLPA) is proposed for detecting missing links and for predicting whether potential links will become real links in the future. First, a level is assigned to each node, which is used to represent the influence strength of the node compared to its neighbours in the initial network snapshot. The level must be updated with changes in the nodes. Then, the connection probability of each potential link is calculated based on the levels of the corresponding nodes and the attraction force between them. Thus, missing links can be detected and potential links can be predicted. In addition, the connection probabilities of potential links calculated via the proposed approach can vary with the evolution of the network. Experiments on static and dynamic real-world networks are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several baseline algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we demonstrate how effectively 4D light fields can be sampled from the real world using a custom-built 4D light field camera system constructed based on cheaply and commonly available Raspberry Pi computers. The camera system consisting of a camera array and a dedicated calibration software is flexible and scalable in structure because the system can be reconfigured easily to meet the user's needs. We show the effectiveness of the camera system by interactively visualizing captured 4D light fields using our GPU-accelerated light field renderer supporting a virtual camera model that synthesizes various photographic effects including zooming and panning, refocusing, focus breathing, and depth-of-field control. We believe that the do-it-yourself 4D light field camera will be explored effectively in traditional application fields, such as computer graphics and vision, and in other areas like science education.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we develop new tools and connections for exponential time approximation. In this setting, we are given a problem instance and an integer r > 1, and the goal is to design an approximation algorithm with the fastest possible running time. We give randomized algorithms that establish an approximation ratio of 1. r for maximum independent set in O*(exp((O) over tilde (n/r log(2) r + r log(2) r))) time, 2. r for chromatic number in O*(exp((O) over tilde (n/r log r + r log(2) r))) time, 3. (2 - 1/r) for minimum vertex cover in O*(exp(n/r(Omega(r)))) time, and 4. (k - 1/r) for minimum k-hypergraph vertex cover in O*(exp(n/(kr)(Omega(kr)))) time. (Throughout, (O) over tilde and O* omit polyloglog(r) and factors polynomial in the input size, respectively.) The best known time bounds for all problems were O*(2n/r) (Bourgeois et al. in Discret Appl Math 159(17): 1954-1970, 2011; Cygan et al. in Exponential-time approximation of hard problems, 2008). For maximum independent set and chromatic number, these bounds were complemented by exp(n(1-o(1))/r(1+o(1))) lower bounds (under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)) (Chalermsook et al. in Foundations of computer science, FOCS, pp. 370-379, 2013; Laekhanukit in Inapproximability of combinatorial problems in subexponential-time. Ph.D. thesis, 2014). Our results show that the naturally-looking O*(2n/r) bounds are not tight for all these problems. The key to these results is a sparsification procedure that reduces a problem to a bounded-degree variant, allowing the use of approximation algorithms for bounded-degree graphs. To obtain the first two results, we introduce a new randomized branching rule. Finally, we show a connection between PCP parameters and exponential-time approximation algorithms. This connection together with our independent set algorithm refute the possibility to overly reduce the size of Chan's PCP (Chan in J. ACM 63(3): 27: 1-27: 32, 2016). It also implies that a (significant) improvement over our result will refute the gap-ETH conjecture (Dinur in Electron Colloq Comput Complex (ECCC) 23: 128, 2016; Manurangsi and Raghavendra in A birthday repetition theorem and complexity of approximating dense CSPs, 2016).",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In the last years, kernelization with structural parameters has been an active area of research within the field of parameterized complexity. As a relevant example, Gajarsky et al. (J Comput Syst Sci 84:219-242, 2017) proved that every graph problem satisfying a property called finite integer index admits a linear kernel on graphs of bounded expansion and an almost linear kernel on nowhere dense graphs, parameterized by the size of a c-treedepth modulator, which is a vertex set whose removal results in a graph of treedepth at most c, where c >= 1 is a fixed integer. The authors left as further research to investigate this parameter on general graphs, and in particular to find problems that, while admitting polynomial kernels on sparse graphs, behave differently on general graphs. In this article we answer this question by finding two very natural such problems: we prove that VERTEX COVER admits a polynomial kernel on general graphs for any integer c >= 1, and that DOMINATING SET does not for any integer c >= 2 even on degenerate graphs, unless NP subset of coNP/poly. For the positive result, we build on the techniques of Jansen and Bodlaender (Proceedings of the 28th symposium on theoretical aspects of computer science (STACS), volume 9 of LIPIcs, pp 177-188, 2011), and for the negative result we use a polynomial parameter transformation for c >= 3 and an or-cross-composition for c = 2. As existing results imply that DOMINATING SET admits a polynomial kernel on degenerate graphs for c = 1, our result provides a dichotomy about the existence of polynomial kernels for DOMINATING SET on degenerate graphs with this parameter.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Energy efficiency is a complex concept which is represented in diverse fields including engineering, economics, energy, computer sciences, environmental sciences, mathematics and physics. The social sciences literature on energy efficiency, however, remains significantly underrepresented, comprising just 2.6% of the total energy efficiency literature found in this study. Energy efficiency is an important energy policy strategy globally to reduce energy consumption, secure energy supply, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, however, evidence shows that on a global scale, energy demand is rising and climate mitigation targets are not being met. There is an acknowledgement by scientists that these challenges cannot be viewed as simply technical in nature but rather the product of collective social and cultural factors. Therefore, more social science research is needed to support an energy transition towards cleaner energy sources. Specifically, there is a need to further disentangle what is meant by energy efficiency from a social sciences perspective, including, critically, its conceptual foundations and practical applications. This review seeks to understand these issues by exploring how energy efficiency is conceptualized, both historically and today, by different actors. Research shows that the way that the concept of energy efficiency is applied to the physical, material world is a value judgement that brings with it societal trade-offs that are not fully understood. That is, that applying any given conceptualization or methodology of energy efficiency to physical processes can privilege certain interests over others, and affect society in different ways. For example, such tradeoffs include pollution displacement, lower than expected energy savings and an unfair cost burden on certain groups. Bringing together technical and qualitative insights from economics, energy, engineering, science and technology studies and history, this review builds on the work of efficiency and energy social scientists to illustrate what we need to do in order to bridge a conceptual gap in the energy efficiency literature, and in practice. The findings show a diversity of conceptualizations in the energy efficiency literature, highlighting the fact that energy efficiency can mean different things depending on how it is defined and applied. The review finds that greater efforts are needed to integrate energy efficiency discussions into sociological frames including ethics, equality, philosophy and history for more diverse, comprehensive and balanced research.",

            "abstract": "Context. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a complex signal and can require several years of training, as well as advanced signal processing and feature extraction methodologies to be correctly interpreted. Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown great promise in helping make sense of EEG signals due to its capacity to learn good feature representations from raw data. Whether DL truly presents advantages as compared to more traditional EEG processing approaches, however, remains an open question. Objective. In this work, we review 154 papers that apply DL to EEG, published between January 2010 and July 2018, and spanning different application domains such as epilepsy, sleep, brain-computer interfacing, and cognitive and affective monitoring. We extract trends and highlight interesting approaches from this large body of literature in order to inform future research and formulate recommendations. Methods. Major databases spanning the fields of science and engineering were queried to identify relevant studies published in scientific journals, conferences, and electronic preprint repositories. Various data items were extracted for each study pertaining to (1) the data, (2) the preprocessing methodology, (3) the DL design choices, (4) the results, and (5) the reproducibility of the experiments. These items were then analyzed one by one to uncover trends. Results. Our analysis reveals that the amount of EEG data used across studies varies from less than ten minutes to thousands of hours, while the number of samples seen during training by a network varies from a few dozens to several millions, depending on how epochs are extracted. Interestingly, we saw that more than half the studies used publicly available data and that there has also been a clear shift from intra-subject to inter-subject approaches over the last few years. About 40% of the studies used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while 13% used recurrent neural networks (RNNs), most often with a total of 3-10 layers. Moreover, almost one-half of the studies trained their models on raw or preprocessed EEG time series. Finally, the median gain in accuracy of DL approaches over traditional baselines was 5.4% across all relevant studies. More importantly, however, we noticed studies often suffer from poor reproducibility: a majority of papers would be hard or impossible to reproduce given the unavailability of their data and code. Significance. To help the community progress and share work more effectively, we provide a list of recommendations for future studies and emphasize the need for more reproducible research.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Software standards, targeted for the software industry, were developed to contribute to the development of quality products within budget and schedule, by optimizing efforts and resources. For small companies, the largest percentage of software companies in Mexico, they are fundamental for their growth and survival. However, academic programs do not always match industry requirements. In previous studies, the curricula in Computer Science and Informatics, and Software Engineering, of 4 Mexican universities, were compared with two software industry standards: the MoProSoft standard, a Mexican standard designed for organizations having up to 50 people and the Basic profile of the ISO/IEC 29110 developed specifically for organizations having up to 25 people. The analysis of the academic programs showed a better coverage of ISO/IEC 29110 than MoProSoft. In this paper, these two standards are mapped to understand the results of the analysis in detail and provide recommendations regarding academic programs. The analysis provides an evidence that the processes of the Basic profile of ISO/IEC 29110 are better covered by the universities curricula because the processes provides the minimal set of practices to be performed while a project is executed from the beginning until the delivery of a software. In addition, this mapping presents a clear differentiation between these two standards that might help Software Development Centers to understand where to start in the implementation of one of them.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Negative permittivity of the material may lead to the enhanced radiation of an antenna embedded in a finite plasma, which suggests a potential way to solve blackout problem in space technology. However, the enhanced radiation phenomenon is still lack of strict theoretical investigations of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in plasma in GHz frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate the SPPs excited at a plasma/vacuum interface in GHz frequency by the consistency of the simulated and theoretical results. With SPPs, plasma layer thicker than skin depth can be penetrated with omega < omega(p), which is a complement of wave propagation theory in plasma. We also discuss the influences of thickness d, collision frequency Gamma, and different plasma frequencies on SPPs. For plasma frequencies with large difference, common numerical methods have difficulties in result comparison under the same mesh size because of the computer capacity and memory. The analytical multilayer method used in the paper does not need to generate mesh, so the studies of plasma frequencies with large difference can be carried out. The simulation shows that the SPPs can be excited for an arbitrary plasma frequency. We believe the study will be beneficial for the problem of wave propagation in plasma science and technology.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Gender has been consistently controlled as a variable in usability and playability tests. However, there is no consensus on whether and how gender differences should influence the design of digital environments. According to some research, digital environments may be unintentionally designed especially for males as a result of the existing gender biases which risks reproducing gender-polarized culture in a computational field. This study attempts to highlight that females are still being negatively affected by existing gender stereotypes and prescribed gender identities despite relatively equal access and use of computer technology. This qualitative study aims to provide insights about the first-time user experience in a home environment of 16 middle school children in Turkey (8 males - 8 females), aged between 11 and 14 years, with a code learning game named \"Code Combat\". The analysis is supported with complementary quantitative findings. The present study investigates the participants' conceptualizations and opinions toward coding concept and this specific coding game. Further, it explores how existing gender stereotypes and gender biased expectations impact their behaviors and attitudes in the context of game experience. Our results indicated that perceived computer competence and perceived coding difficulty had important effects on the participants' performance relatedly with their gender identity. According to our findings, there are important gender differences to be found in our 9 constructs, namely; perceived computer competence, perceived coding difficulty, identification, perceived game difficulty, perceived success, level of enjoyment, level of anxiety, the likelihood of playing it another time and the likelihood of trying new features.",

            "abstract": "Recent international efforts have focused on broadening opportunities for students to learn computer science (CS) in schools, prompting expansion of professional development (PD) programs for educators. But there is little research supporting the ongoing professional needs of computing teachers. This qualitative study examined how in-service CS teachers approached, learned, and anticipated teaching a hands-on electronic-textiles unit. Our findings illustrate that \"problems of practice\" from the classroom served as a compass to guide CS educators' learning in PD. We also share implications for key features of PD programs that can transform the pedagogical knowledge and classroom practices of experienced teachers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "A pedagogical comparison of emergence-of-life research and rocket science is made in order to inform how environmental disequilibria at the ocean/crust interface on the early Earth - a 1 V battery - forced life's emergence as an inescapable mechanism for their dissipation. Likely fuels and oxidants to drive life into being were hydrogen plus methane, borne by rising alkaline hydrothermal solutions, juxtaposed with ocean waters containing dilute nitric plus carbonic acids carbureted along the outside of a spontaneously precipitated semipermeable metal hydroxide/sulfide mound. As a comparison, hydrogen and methane can also be used as fuels for rockets, with nitric acid as an oxidant, carefully distributed through the mixing head to the combustion chamber. Whereas a full burn is the goal of the rocket engineer, the first living entities were best served by incomplete reactions and thereby the production of metastable intermediates that could further interact to beat the first metabolic pathway to life. In this analogy the hydrothermal mound is broadly comparable to the rocket while individual engines comprise the variable valence and conformationally flexible mineral, green rust (similar to[Fe42+Fe23+(OH12](2+)[CO3 center dot 3H(2)O](2-)) dosed with Ni, Co, Mo and W. With its internal layers of water and counter ions, we also compare the operations of green rust to a slow ramjet. This green rust 'ramjet' is driven by steep gradients in protons, electrons, anions and uncharged molecules, through the hydrous interlayers from either side of the mineral membrane separating the contrasting fluids and which green rust partly comprises. The mineral can rapidly reduce nitrate to ammonia and, therefrom, aminate pyruvate to the amino acid alanine. The higher amino acids may also be synthesized and polymers thereby act as primitive proteins, enzymes and cell walls. The main challenge now is to figure out how this green rust system, with its variable valence pattern of 2 + and 3 + cations, could govern growth and reproduction and, eventually, evolve toward a replicative world partly governed by nucleotides. Inanimate rockets of course, need their guidance systems installed, and most are fully autonomous.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Engineered tubular constructs made from soft biomaterials are employed in a myriad of applications in biomedical science. Potential uses of these constructs range from vascular grafts to conduits for enabling perfusion of engineered tissues and organs. The fabrication of standalone tubes or complex perfusable constructs from biofunctional materials, including hydrogels, via rapid and readily accessible routes is desirable. Here we report a methodology in which customized coaxial nozzles are 3D printed using commercially available stereolithography (SLA) 3D printers. These nozzles can be used for the fabrication of hydrogel tubes via coextrusion of two shear-thinning hydrogels: an unmodified Pluronic (R) F-127 (F127) hydrogel and an F127-bisurethane methacrylate (F127-BUM) hydrogel. We demonstrate that different nozzle geometries can be modeled via computer-aided design and 3D printed in order to generate tubes or coaxial filaments with different cross-sectional geometries. We were able to fabricate tubes with luminal diameters or wall thicknesses as small as similar to 150 mu m. Finally, we show that these tubes can be functionalized with collagen I to enable cell adhesion, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells can be cultured on the luminal surfaces of these tubes to yield tubular endothelial monolayers. Our approach could enable the rapid fabrication of biofunctional hydrogel conduits which can ultimately be utilized for engineering in vitro models of tubular biological structures.",

            "abstract": "Given the ubiquity of lattice models in physics, it is imperative for researchers to possess robust methods for quantifying clusters on the lattice - whether they be Ising spins or clumps of molecules. Inspired by biophysical studies, we present Python code for handling clusters on a 2D periodic lattice. Properties of individual clusters, such as their area, can be obtained with a few function calls. Our code invokes an unsupervised machine learning method called hierarchical clustering, which is simultaneously effective for the present problem and simple enough for non-experts to grasp qualitatively. Moreover, our code transparently merges clusters neighboring each other across periodic boundaries using breadth-first search (BFS), an algorithm well-documented in computer science pedagogy. The fact that our code is written in Python - instead of proprietary languages - further enhances its value for reproducible science. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We compare the learning gains of eighth-grade students in a U.S. public school who used a Single User Participatory Simulation (SUPS) with a comparison group who learned the same concepts using a conventional simulation. We find that the SUPS affords significantly larger learning gains and that it is no more likely than the conventional simulation to cause misconceptions. In addition, we find that users of the participatory simulation report significantly more interest and enjoyment than users of the conventional simulation. Additional qualitative analysis suggests that students perceive participatory simulations as more helpful because they enable a deeper interaction with the model and are more engaging than conventional simulations. Our findings contribute to ongoing research on the contribution of physical movement in reducing cognitive load. In addition it deepens the understanding of design features that enhance emotional engagement while using simulations, and the relation of emotional engagement to the learning gains of the users.",

Three types of debates were concerned due to their abundant production of arguments: the debates between the (1) O vs. A, (2) O vs. M, and (3) O vs. N position students. The quasi-experimental design was adopted in which three 11th grade classes totaling 108 students were invited. They were assigned to the three required types of debate according to their positions regarding two given SS's. The results showed that there were significant differences among the three debates on both the conceptual understanding and arguments produced by the students. The OA debate exhibited the best performance no matter in the conceptual understanding and the use of claims, warrants, and rebuttals. Moreover, the OM debate exhibited the best performance in terms of the use of qualifiers, whereas the ON debate students exhibited the lowest abilities and improvements.",

In this work, we propose a new combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for the problem which relies on a novel bounding procedure capable of pruning a very large amount of nodes of the branch-and-bound tree. Extensive computational experiments on random and structured graphs, encompassing standard benchmarks used in the literature as well as recently introduced real-world large-scale graphs, show that our new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude on many instances.

A computer generated optimal design of experiment based on the I-optimality criteria along with analysis of variance was created to study the characterizations in turning of this steel, and desirability function was utilized for the optimization. The global optimization, combined high surface quality and productivity with low cutting power consumption, gave 12 optimal setting points provided high desirability values.

            "abstract": "The study of algebraic properties of ordered structures has shown that their behavior in many cases is different from algebraic structures. For example, the analogues of the fundamental mapping theorem for sets which characterizes surjective maps as quotient sets modulo their kernel relations, is not true for order-preserving maps between posets (partially ordered sets). The main objective of this paper is to study the quotients of dcpos (directed complete partially ordered sets), and their relations with surjective dcpo maps (directed join preserving maps). The motivation of studying such infinitary ordered structures is their importance in domain theory, a theory on the borderline of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, introducing the notion of a pre-congruence on dcpos (directed complete partially ordered sets), we give a characterization of dcpo congruences. Also, it is proved that unlike natural dcpo congruences, the dcpo congruences are precisely kernels of surjective dcpo maps. Also, while it is known that the image of a dcpo map is not necessarily a subdcpo of its codomain, we find equivalent conditions on a dcpo map to satisfy this property. Moreover, we prove the Decomposition Theorem and its consequences for dcpo maps. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We also discuss how the nature of the firm (Business to Consumer versus Business-to-Business, i.e. B2C vs. B2B), service characteristics (utilitarian vs. hedonic), and brand positioning (low equity vs. high equity) might moderate the relationship between DRA and service quality.

Computer models with structural invariance properties now appear frequently in materials science, physics, biology, and other fields. These properties are consequences of dependency on structural geometry, and cannot be accommodated by standard statistical emulation methods. In this article, we propose a statistical framework for building emulators to preserve invariance. The framework uses a weighted complete graph to represent the geometry and introduces a new class of function, called the relabeling symmetric functions, associated with the graph. We establish a characterization theorem of the relabeling symmetric functions and propose a nonparametric kernel method for estimating such functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by examples from materials science. Supplemental material for this article can be found online.",

            "abstract": "In a highly influential paper twenty years ago, Barabasi and Albert [science 286, 509 (1999)] showed that networks undergoing generic growth processes with preferential attachment evolve towards scale-free structures. In any finite system, the growth eventually stalls and is likely to be followed by a phase of network contraction due to node failures, attacks, or epidemics. Using the master equation formulation and computer simulations, we analyze the structural evolution of networks subjected to contraction processes via random, preferential, and propagating node deletions. We show that the contracting networks converge towards an Erdos-Renyi network structure whose mean degree continues to decrease as the contraction proceeds. This is manifested by the convergence of the degree distribution towards a Poisson distribution and the loss of degree-degree correlations.",

            "title": "Information and Communication Systems to Tackle Barriers to Breastfeeding: Systematic Search and Review",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: Breastfeeding has many benefits for newborns, mothers, and the wider society. The World Health Organization recommends mothers to feed newborns exclusively with breastmilk for the first 6 months after birth, but breastfeeding rates in many countries fail to align with the recommendations because of various barriers. Breastfeeding success is associated with a number of determinants, such as self-efficacy, intention to breastfeed, and attitudes toward breastfeeding. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been leveraged to support breastfeeding by means of improving knowledge or providing practical supports in different maternal stages. Previous reviews have examined and summarized the effectiveness and credibility of interventions; however, no review has been done from a human-computer interaction perspective that is concerned with novel interaction techniques and the perspective of end users. Objective: The objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of existing digital interventions that support breastfeeding by investigating systems' objective, technology design, validation process, and quality attributes, both in terms of clinical parameters as well as usability and user experience. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in the following libraries: PubMed, Science Direct, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library (ACM Digital Library), and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore (IEEE Xplore). Results: A total of 35 papers discussing 30 interventions were included. The main goals of these interventions were organized into 4 categories: breastfeeding education (n=12), breastfeeding promotion (n=8), communication support (n=6), and daily practical support (n=4). Of the interventions, 13 target mothers in the postnatal period. Most interventions come in forms of client communication systems (n=18), which frequently leverage Web technologies, text message, and mobile apps to provide breastfeeding support. Systems predominantly focus on mothers; validation strategies were rather heterogeneous, with 12 user studies concerning usability and user experience and 18 clinical validation studies focusing on the effects of the interventions on breastfeeding determinants; 5 papers did not report results. Generally, straightforward systems (eg, communication tools or Web based solutions) seem to be more effective than complex interventions (eg, games). Conclusions: Existing information and communication systems offer effective means of improving breastfeeding outcomes, but they do not address all relevant periods in parenthood (eg, the antenatal period) and often do not involve important stakeholders, such as partners. There is an opportunity to leverage more complex technical systems to open up avenues for the broader design of ICT to support breastfeeding; however, considering evaluation outcomes of existing support systems of higher complexity, such systems need to be designed with care.",

            "abstract": "Version Control Systems are commonly used by Information and communication technology professionals. These systems allow monitoring programmers activity working in a project. Thus, Version Control Systems are also used by educational institutions. The aim of this work is to evaluate if the academic success of students may be predicted by monitoring their interaction with a Version Control System. In order to do so, we have built a Machine Learning model which predicts student results in a specific practical assignment of the Operating Systems Extension subject, from the second course of the degree in Computer Science of the University of Leon, through their interaction with a Git repository. To build the model, several classifiers and predictors have been evaluated. In order to do so, we have developed Model Evaluator (MoEv), a tool to evaluate Machine Learning models in order to get the most suitable for a specific problem. Prior to the model development, a feature selection from input data is done. The resulting model has been trained using results from 2016-2017 course and later validated using results from 2017-2018 course. Results conclude that the model predicts students' success with a success high percentage.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Quantum information science has the potential to revolutionize modern technology by providing resource-efficient approaches to computing(1), communication(2) and sensing(3). Although the physical qubits in a realistic quantum device will inevitably suffer errors, quantum error correction creates a path to fault-tolerant quantum information processing(4). Quantum error correction, however, requires that individual qubits can interact with many other qubits in the processor. Engineering such high connectivity can pose a challenge for platforms such as electron spin qubits(5), which naturally favour linear arrays. Here we present an experimental demonstration of the transmission of electron spin states via the Heisenberg exchange interaction in an array of spin qubits. Heisenberg exchange coupling-a direct manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents any two electrons with the same spin state from occupying the same orbital-tends to swap the spin states of neighbouring electrons. By precisely controlling the wavefunction overlap between electrons in a semiconductor quadruple quantum dot array, we generate a series of coherent SWAP operations to transfer both single-spin and entangled states back and forth in the array without moving any electrons. Because the process is scalable to large numbers of qubits, state transfer through Heisenberg exchange will be useful for multi-qubit gates and error correction in spin-based quantum computers.",

            "abstract": "Background: This study examines the development of the connected health (CH) research landscape with a view to providing an overview of the existing CH research. The research field of CH has experienced rapid growth coinciding with increasing pressure on health care systems to become more proactive and patient centered. Objective: This study aimed to assess the extent and coverage of the current body of knowledge in CH. In doing so, we sought to identify specific topics that have drawn the attention of CH researchers and to identify research gaps, in particular those offering opportunities for further interdisciplinary research. Methods: A systematic mapping study that combined scientific contributions from research in the disciplines of medicine, business, computer science, and engineering was used. Overall, seven classification criteria were used to analyze the papers, including publication source, publication year, research type, empirical type, contribution type, research topic, and the medical condition studied. Results: The search resulted in 208 papers that were analyzed by a multidisciplinary group of researchers. The results indicated a slow start for CH research but showed a more recent steady upswing since 2013. The majority of papers proposed health care solutions (77/208, 37.0%) or evaluated CH approaches (49/208, 23.5%). Case studies (59/208, 28.3%) and experiments (55/208, 26.4%) were the most popular forms of scientific validation used. Diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and heart conditions were among the most prevalent medical conditions studied. Conclusions: We conclude that CH research has become an established field of research that has grown over the last five years. The results of this study indicate a focus on technology-driven research with a strong contribution from medicine, whereas the business aspects of CH have received less research attention.",

            "abstract": "The number of digital resources that exist in repositories and on the Internet in general is enormous. Recovering resources that fit with the user's specific needs poses a problem. To solve this problem, metainformation is added to the resources. One type of metainformation is the classification of a resource using a classification system that is widely recognised and agreed upon by its users. In this way, each resource is assigned a precise place within the classification system, thus facilitating its location. This article proposes a taxonomy for the classification of the resources (notes, exercises, exams or programmes that could be stored within a digital repository) that are generated within the scope of a Mathematical Logic course for a computer science degree programme. It also describes how to represent the proposed taxonomy using the IMS-VDEX standard and how to integrate it in the LOM and Dublin Core metadata specifications and proposes a set of controlled vocabularies that make it possible to refine the taxonomic metainformation.",

            "abstract": "The instantaneous quantum polynomial time (IQP) model is one of promising models to demonstrate a quantum computational advantage over classical computers. If the IQP model can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer, an unlikely consequence in computer science can be obtained (under some unproven conjectures). In order to experimentally demonstrate the advantage using medium or large-scale IQP circuits, it is inevitable to efficiently verify whether the constructed IQP circuits faithfully work. There exist two types of IQP models, each of which is the sampling on hypergraph states or weighted graph states. For the first-type IQP model, polynomial-time verification protocols have already been proposed. In this paper, we propose verification protocols for the second-type IQP model. To this end, we propose polynomial-time fidelity estimation protocols of weighted graph states for each of the following four situations where a verifier can (i) choose any measurement basis and perform adaptive measurements, (ii) only choose restricted measurement bases and perform adaptive measurements, (iii) choose any measurement basis and only perform non-adaptive measurements, and (iv) only choose restricted measurement bases and only perform non-adaptive measurements. In all of our verification protocols, the verifier's quantum operations are only single-qubit measurements. Since we assume no independent and identically distributed property on quantum states, our protocols work in any situation.",

            "abstract": "Background: Childhood leukemia is one of the most common cancers in children. As a potential treatment for leukemia, immunotherapy has become a new research hotspot. This research aimed at exploring the status and trends of current researches on immunotherapy for childhood leukemia through bibliometric analysis. Methods: The Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science core collection database was searched for articles on immunotherapy and childhood leukemia using a computer. Time period for retrieval was from the beginning of the database to June 15, 2019. The top 100 highly cited articles were selected to extract their information on publication year, authors, title, publication journal, number of citations, author's affiliations, country, and so on. These general information and bibliometric data were collected for analysis. VOSviewer software was used to generate a figure for keywords' co-occurrence network and a figure for researcher's coauthorship network that visualized reference and cooperation patterns for different terms in the 100 articles. Results: The number of citations in the top 100 articles ranged from 17 to 471. These articles were published in 52 different publications. The top four journals in terms of the number of our selected articles were Leukemia (11 articles), Blood (10 articles), Bone Marrow Transplantation (6 articles), and Clinical Cancer Research. The most frequently nominated author was T. Klingebiel from Goethe University Frankfurt, and of the top 100 articles, 12 listed his name. These top 100 articles were published after the year 2000. Most of these articles were original (67%). The United States and Germany were the major countries researching immunotherapy for childhood leukemia and made significant contributions to the combat against the disease. Adoptive immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation appeared more frequently in keywords. Conclusions: This study analyzed the top 100 highly cited articles on immunotherapy for childhood leukemia and provided insights into the features and research hotspots of the articles on this issue.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Teaching cases are crucial for computer science (e.g., software testing) teaching. With the fast development of computer science, old and outdated teaching cases cannot meet the requirements of teaching. Therefore, teachers need to update teaching case repository continually and timely. However, teaching case development is an extremely time-consuming work. Given today's complex and fast-moving environment of computer science, teachers often feel blind about about what types of cases should be added for teaching. This paper presents UTCPredictor-an automated approach of predicting novel teaching cases from real production by identifying the most uncertain data, which are always with new features that reflect the latest developments and trends in the field. The implementation of UTCPredictor is based on the idea of interactive machine learning as well as several text mining techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of UTCPredictor, we take bug report case building in software testing teaching as an example, using UTCPredictor to perform 10-fold cross-validation on an existing teaching case set. The performance in terms of indicators; Recall, Precision, and F1-score, achieved three very competitive values-0.91, 0.94, and 0.85, respectively. We further evaluate the effectiveness of UTCPredictor through a user study and a questionnaire. The results are very positive; the user study indicates that educators can build a teaching case set from latest bug report repository by spending only 8.16%-18.11% time costs compared with traditional manual approach; the responses from 2,000 students for the questionnaire show that the teaching cases built with UTCPredictor are very popular among students.",

In this paper, we study several aspects of the higher Cheeger constants. Our results include methods for bounding the cosystolic norm of k-cochains and the k-th Cheeger constants, with applications to the expansion of pseudomanifolds, Coxeter complexes and homogenous geometric lattices. We revisit a theorem of Gromov on the expansion of a product of a complex with a simplex and provide an elementary derivation of the expansion in a hypercube. We prove a lower bound on the maximal cosystole in a complex and an upper bound on the expansion of bounded degree complexes and give an essentially sharp estimate for the cosystolic norm of the Paley cochains. Finally, we discuss a non-abelian version of the one-dimensional expansion of a simplex, with an application to a question of Babson on bounded quotients of the fundamental group of a random 2-complex.",

            "abstract": "In the last several decades, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has been widely used by consumers on different digital platforms to gather feedback about products and services from previous customer behavior. However, this useful information is getting blurred by fake reviews-i.e., reviews that were created artificially and are thus not representative of real customer opinions. The present study aims to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of fake online reviews in the tourism sector on social networking and online reviews sites. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on fake reviews for tourism businesses. Our focus was on previous studies that addressed the following two main topics: (i) tourism (ii) fake reviews. Scientific databases were used to collect relevant literature. The search terms \"tourism\" and \"fake reviews\" were applied. The database of Web of Science produced a total of 124 articles and, after the application of different filters following the PRISMA 2009 Flow diagram, the process resulted in the selection of 17 studies. Our results demonstrate that (i) the analysis of fake reviews is interdisciplinary, ranging from Computer Science to Business and Management, (ii) the methods are based on algorithms and sentiment analysis, while other methodologies are rarely used; and (iii) the current and future state of fraudulent detection is based on emotional approaches, semantic analysis and new technologies such as Blockchain. This study also provides helpful strategies to counteract the ubiquity of fake reviews for tourism businesses.",

            "abstract": "Direct and quantitative characterization of polymer networks without theoretical assumptions remains a big challenge in polymer and materials science due to their insolubility. Here we propose a partially decrosslinkable network (PDN) as a platform for the direct characterization of the entire network through analyzing its retainable units after decrosslinking. A PDN is synthesized by the polymerization of monomers having at least two uncleavable and several cleavable functional groups. It contains cleavable chains and loops formed by cleavable and uncleavable groups, respectively. After decrosslinking, the PDN transforms into soluble oligomers including unaltered network chains, dangling chains and various loops that can be directly qualified and quantified by normal techniques. Besides linear oligomers, various loops with up to eight units have been directly observed and the primary, secondary and tertiary loops have been quantitatively probed. The PDN provides a powerful protocol for direct and quantitative characterization of linear and cyclic units of polymer networks. The direct measurement of retainable loops provides comprehensive information of high-order topologies within the network, which leads to a profound understanding of the polymerization-structure-performance relationship.",

            "abstract": "Fractional-order derivative is attracting more and more attention of researchers in image processing because of its better property in restoring more texture than the total variation. To improve the performance of fractional-order variation model in image restoration, a truncated fractional-order variation model was proposed in Chan and Liang [Truncated fractional-order variation model for image restoration, J. Oper. Res. Soc. China]. In this paper, we propose a dual approach to solve this truncated fractional-order variation model on noise removal. The proposed algorithm is based on the dual approach proposed by Chambolle [An algorithm for total variation minimisation and applications, J. Math Imaging Vis. 20 (2004), pp. 89-97]. Conversely, the Chambolle's dual approach can be treated as a special case of the proposed algorithm with fractional order . The work of this paper modifies the result in Zhang et al.

Based on the truncation, the convergence of the proposed dual method can be analysed and the convergence criteria can be provided.

            "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to establish the associations between lifestyle-related risk factors during pregnancy with a special focus on low-to-moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and behavioral problems in adolescents. Methods: We used a sample of 6,149 German adolescents (11-17 years) from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). To investigate behavioral problems, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was applied. Results: The prevalence of behavioral problems was: 17.0% hyperactivity, 12.0% conduct problems, 13.8% emotional symptoms, 22.2% peer relationship problems, and 11.9% total difficulties score. Simultaneously, 14.1% of the adolescents experienced low-to-moderate PAE. Adjusting for confounders, low-to-moderate PAE resulted in an increased risk of hyperactivity (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.39, Confidence Interval (CI) [1.15, 1.69]) and peer relationship problems (OR 1.20, CI [1.00, 1.44]). Similarly, smoking during pregnancy significantly increased the risk of hyperactivity and peer-relationship problems in adolescent offspring. Conclusions: Low-to-moderate PAE is clearly linked to an increased risk of behavioral problems in adolescent offspring.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In sports science research, there are many topics that utilize the body motion of athletes extracted by motion capture system, since motion information is valuable data for improving an athlete's skills. However, one of the unsolved challenges in motion capture is extraction of athletes' motion information during the actual game or match, as placing markers on athletes is a challenge during game play. In this research, the authors propose a method for acquisition of motion information without attaching a marker, utilizing computer vision technology. In the proposed method, the three-dimensional world joint position of the athlete's body can be acquired using just two cameras without any visual markers. Furthermore, the athlete's three-dimensional joint position during game play can also be obtained without complicated preparations. Camera calibration that estimates the projective relationship between three-dimensional world and two-dimensional image spaces is one of the principal processes for the respective three-dimensional image processing, such as three-dimensional reconstruction and three-dimensional tracking. A strong-calibration method, which needs to set up landmarks with known three-dimensional positions, is a common technique. However, as the target space expands, landmark placement becomes increasingly complicated. Although a weak-calibration method does not need known landmarks, the estimation precision depends on the accuracy of the correspondence between image captures. When multiple cameras are arranged sparsely, sufficient detection of corresponding points is difficult. In this research, the authors propose a calibration method that bridges multiple sparsely distributed cameras using mobile camera images. Appropriate spacing was confirmed between the images through comparative experiments evaluating camera calibration accuracy by changing the number of bridging images. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to multiple capturing experiments in a large-scale space to verify its robustness. As a relevant example, the proposed method was applied to the three-dimensional skeleton estimation of badminton players. Subsequently, a quantitative evaluation was conducted on camera calibration for the three-dimensional skeleton. The reprojection error of each part of the skeletons and standard deviations were approximately 2.72 and 0.81 mm, respectively, confirming that the proposed method was highly accurate when applied to camera calibration. Consequently, a quantitative evaluation was conducted on the proposed calibration method and a calibration method using the coordinates of eight manual points. In conclusion, the proposed method stabilizes calibration accuracy in the vertical direction of the world coordinate system.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The angular momentum of molecules, or, equivalently, their rotation in three-dimensional space, is ideally suited for quantum control. Molecular angular momentum is naturally quantized, time evolution is governed by a well-known Hamiltonian with only a few accurately known parameters, and transitions between rotational levels can be driven by external fields from various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Control over the rotational motion can be exerted in one-, two-, and many-body scenarios, thereby allowing one to probe Anderson localization, target stereoselectivity of bimolecular reactions, or encode quantum information to name just a few examples. The corresponding approaches to quantum control are pursued within separate, and typically disjoint, subfields of physics, including ultrafast science, cold collisions, ultracold gases, quantum information science, and condensed-matter physics. It is the purpose of this review to present the various control phenomena, which all rely on the same underlying physics, within a unified framework. To this end, recall the Hamiltonian for free rotations, assuming the rigid rotor approximation to be valid, and summarize the different ways for a rotor to interact with external electromagnetic fields. These interactions can be exploited for control from achieving alignment, orientation, or laser doling in a one-body framework, steering bimolecular collisions, or realizing a quantum computer or quantum simulator in the many-body setting.",

            "abstract": "Transdisciplinarity aims to address 'grand societal challenges' especially in the sustainability area through realizing 'alternative' ways of knowledge production which integrate societal actors into research. Yet, despite considerable political and scholarly effort and support, the numerous initiatives and programs devoted to produce 'societally relevant knowledge' often yield rather conventional scientific output. For understanding why this is the case, this research investigates how researchers who were engaged in the Austrian research program proVISION made sense of 'societal relevance' and how they made it do-able in practice. The findings suggest rather uniform coping practices for dealing with inherent tensions between different kinds of relevance. Alignment between them could almost exclusively be achieved through quantification and computer modelling, which reinforced a positivistic understanding of relevance. The scarcity of more diverse collective coping strategies is taken as a starting point for developing conclusions for research funding.",

Recently, it has also been introduced in food science and engineering. To our knowledge, this review is the first in the food domain. In this paper, we provided a brief introduction of deep learning and detailedly described the structure of some popular architectures of deep neural networks and the approaches for training a model. We surveyed dozens of articles that used deep learning as the data analysis tool to solve the problems and challenges in food domain, including food recognition, calories estimation, quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat and aquatic products, food supply chain, and food contamination. The specific problems, the datasets, the preprocessing methods, the networks and frameworks used, the performance achieved, and the comparison with other popular solutions of each research were investigated. We also analyzed the potential of deep learning to be used as an advanced data mining tool in food sensory and consume researches. The result of our survey indicates that deep learning outperforms other methods such as manual feature extractors, conventional machine learning algorithms, and deep learning as a promising tool in food quality and safety inspection. The encouraging results in classification and regression problems achieved by deep learning will attract more research efforts to apply deep learning into the field of food in the future.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate students' decisions in example-based instruction within a novel self-regulated learning context. The novelty was the use of automated generators of worked examples and problem-solving exercises instead of a few handcrafted ones. According to the cognitive load theory, when students are in control of their learning, they demonstrate different preferences in selecting worked examples or problem solving exercises for maximizing their learning. An unlimited supply of examples and exercises, however, offers unprecedented degree of flexibility that should alter the decisions of students in scheduling the instruction. Design/methodology/approach ASolver, an online learning environment augmented with such generators for studying computer algorithms in an operating systems course, was developed as the experimental platform. Students' decisions related to choosing worked examples or problem-solving exercises were logged and analyzed. Findings Results show that students had a tendency to attempt many exercises and examples, especially when performance measurement events were impending. Strong students had greater appetite for both exercises and examples than weak students, and they were found to be more adventurous and less bothered by scaffolding. On the other hand, weak students were found to be more timid or unmotivated. They need support in the form of procedural scaffolding to guide the learning. Originality/value This study was one of the first to introduce automated example generators for studying an operating systems course and investigate students' behaviors in such learning environments.",

            "abstract": "Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy was used to study the structural properties of Paracetamol (PCM) and its aqueous solutions in varying amount of concentrations. The dielectric and electrical properties of PCM pellet (at a constant temperature of 300.15 K) and of aqueous PCM solutions (over a temperature range of 293.15 K-323.15 K in steps of 10 K) were determined in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 2 MHz. Agilent precision LCR meter E4980A, with four terminal liquid test fixture Agilent 16452A (for aqueous solutions of PCM) and solid test fixture 16451B (for PCM pellet) were used for the measurements. From the measured dielectric data, other electrical parameters like complex modulus (M*), complex impedance (Z*) and complex electrical conductivity (sigma*) were calculated. Obtained data were analyzed to gain information about structure of PCM as well as the nature of PCM-water interactions. Results can be effectively used in the field of pharmaceutical sciences particularly in designing, development and synthesis of drugs. Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been performed for selected concentrations of PCM in water in order to understand the actual mechanism of H-bonding interactions in the solutions and to confirm the inferences derived from the experimental results.

Considering the mathematical analysis, the framework of multiagent systems has proven to be very useful. This article explores convergence behavior of d-dimensional multiagent systems with particular emphasis on opinion dynamics under bounded confidence. Conditions are given that guarantee geometrically fast convergence to consensus, sharpening in particular a well-known theorem on Markov chains. A crucial condition to get consensus is what we call the principle of the third agent. In case overall consensus is not reachable, the process of fragmentation is analyzed and partial consensus among agents is proven given certain assumptions. Using these assumptions, the principle of the third agent holds for subgroups of agents.",

Acquiring and analyzing the data produced with this combination of tools requires overcoming multiple technical hurdles. Due in part to these technical hurdles, the field lacks standard routines for EMG data collection and analysis. This poses a problem for study replication and direct comparisons. Although software toolboxes already exist that perform either online EMG data visualization or offline analysis, there currently are no openly available toolboxes that flexibly perform both and also interface directly with peripheral EMG and TMS equipment. Here, we introduce Visualize EMG TMS Analyze (VETA), a MATLAB-based toolbox that supports simultaneous EMG data collection and visualization as well as automated offline processing and is specially tailored for use with motor TMS. The VETA toolbox enables the simultaneous recording of EMG, timed administration of TMS, and presentation of behavioral stimuli from a single computer. These tools also provide a streamlined analysis pipeline with interactive data visualization. Finally, VETA offers a standard EMG data format to facilitate data sharing and open science.",

Despite overall change, differences persist in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This Viewpoints article on gender disparities in STEM offers an overarching perspective by addressing what the issues are, why the issues may emerge, and how the issues may be solved. In Part 1, recent data on gaps in representation, compensation, and recognition (awards, grants, publications) are reviewed, highlighting differences across subfields (e.g., computer science vs biology) and across career trajectories (e.g., bachelor's degrees vs senior faculty). In Part 2, evidence on leading explanations for these gaps, including explanations centered on abilities, preferences, and explicit and implicit bias, is presented. Particular attention is paid to implicit bias: mental processes that exist largely outside of conscious awareness and control in both male and female perceivers and female targets themselves. Given its prevalence and persistence, implicit bias warrants a central focus for research and application. Finally, in Part 3, the current knowledge is presented on interventions to change individuals' beliefs and behaviors, as well as organizational culture and practices. The moral issues surrounding equal access aside, understanding and addressing the complex issues surrounding gender in STEM are important because of the possible benefits to STEM and society that will be realized only when full participation of all capable and qualified individuals is guaranteed.",

New evidence from British official archives, presented here, makes clear that Westminster and Whitehall were never persuaded of this view, and always believed that political meddling and microeconomic inefficiencies would ultimately restrain and undermine Soviet growth.",

We here develop the noninformative priors such as the probability matching priors and the reference priors for the parameters in the bivariate lomax population. It turns out that the reference prior satisfy a first order matching criterion only for some parameter groupings. We also check the conditions for the propriety of posterior distributions under the general prior class including the matching priors and the reference priors. It is a quite interesting that the posterior distributions under the reference priors for some parameter groupings are proper, but those for the other parameter groupings are improper.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In recent years, the contribution of various disciplines and professionals (i.e., from marketing, computer science, psychology, and pedagogy) to museum management has encouraged the development of a new conception of museology. Specifically, psychology has affected the overall conception of museum and the visitors toward a more holistic vision of the museum experience as a complexity of memory, personal drives, group identity, meaning-making process, as well as leisure preferences. In this regard, psychological research contributes to advance the scientific knowledge about psychological and social phenomena related to the visitor experience, as well as to design innovative technologies and future tourism services. The present contribution discusses the Socio-Cultural Activity Theory (AT) as a theoretical framework to conceptualize the museum visit as an activity mediated by the technology, and to better identify the factors shaping the interaction between the visitors and the technologies. To do so, a case study is presented: a qualitative research performed at the Ara Pacis Museum in Rome (Italy) to analyze the visitor experience of a tour that integrates augmented and virtual reality. Information derived from applying AT on visitors' experience highlight the value of technology as mediating tool between the museum mission and the visitor experience, considering the interaction between visitors' characteristics, museum environmental dimensions, and technology's features.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Treatment planning is an essential step of the radiotherapy workflow. It has become more sophisticated over the past couple of decades with the help of computer science, enabling planners to design highly complex radiotherapy plans to minimize the normal tissue damage while persevering sufficient tumor control. As a result, treatment planning has become more labor intensive, requiring hours or even days of planner effort to optimize an individual patient case in a trial-and-error fashion. More recently, artificial intelligence has been utilized to automate and improve various aspects of medical science. For radiotherapy treatment planning, many algorithms have been developed to better support planners. These algorithms focus on automating the planning process and/or optimizing dosimetric trade-offs, and they have already made great impact on improving treatment planning efficiency and plan quality consistency. In this review, the smart planning tools in current clinical use are summarized in 3 main categories: automated rule implementation and reasoning, modeling of prior knowledge in clinical practice, and multicriteria optimization. Novel artificial intelligence-based treatment planning applications, such as deep learning-based algorithms and emerging research directions, are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges of artificial intelligence-based treatment planning are discussed for future works.",

However, due to the accessibility of pre-print versions of articles, there might be some loops in a publication citation network. This article presents a descriptive statistic on loops in publication citation networks of computer science and physics by employing a network-based indicator, namely, strongly connected component (SCC). By employing computer science and physics disciplines publications from the Web of Science database as examples, this article examines the count of loops, how the count changes over time and how the count relates to the published year difference between publications within the loop in the citation network. Some common structural patterns are also extracted and analysed; we observe that the two disciplines share the most frequent patterns though there exist some minor differences. Moreover, we find that self-citations in terms of authors, authors' institutions and journals contribute to the formation of loops in publication citation networks.",

            "abstract": "Objective:Dermoscopy is a useful technique for improving the diagnostic accuracy of various types of skin disorders. In China, dermoscopy has been widely accepted, and domestic researchers have made tremendous progress in the field of dermoscopy. The main purpose of this review is to summarize the current status of dermoscopy in China and identify its future directions.Data sources:Articles included in this review were obtained by searching the following databases: Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and the Web of Science. We focused on research published before 2019 with keywords including dermoscopy, dermoscopic, dermoscope and trichoscopy.Study selection:A total of 50 studies were selected. Of these studies, 20 studies were in Chinese and 30 in English, research samples of all the studies were collected from Chinese populations.Results:Since 2000, more than 380 articles about dermoscopy have been published in domestic or foreign journals. Dermoscopy can improve the diagnostic accuracy of neoplastic diseases, evaluating the therapeutic effect of treatment, and determining the treatment endpoint, and it can also assist in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory diseases and in the assessment of the severity of the disease. In addition, researches about the applications of dermoscopy during surgical treatment have been published. Training courses aiming to improve the diagnostic ability of dermatologists, either face-to-face or online, have been offered. The Chinese Skin Image Database, launched in 2017 as a work platform for dermatologists, has promoted the development of dermoscopy in China. Computer-aided diagnostic systems based on the Chinese population are ready for use. In the future, cooperation, resource sharing, talent development, image management, and computer-aided diagnosis will be important directions for the development of dermoscopy in China.Conclusion:Dermoscopy has been widely used and developed in China, however, it still needs to address more challenges in the future.",

            "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) has experienced a significant growth in the recent decades. Simulating systems consisting of hundreds of thousands of atoms is a routine task of computational chemistry researchers nowadays. Thanks to the straightforwardly parallelizable structure of the algorithms, the most promising method to speed-up MD calculations is exploiting the large-scale processing power offered by the parallel hardware architecture of graphics processing units or GPUs. Programming GPUs is becoming easier with general-purpose GPU computing frameworks and higher levels of abstraction. In the recent years, implementing MD simulations on graphics processors has gained a large interest, with multiple popular software packages including some form of GPU-acceleration support. Different approaches have been developed regarding various aspects of the algorithms, with important differences in the specific solutions. Focusing on published works in the field of classical MD, we describe the chosen implementation methods and algorithmic techniques used for porting to GPU, as well as how recent advances of GPU architectures will provide even more optimization possibilities in the future.

            "abstract": "Atomic-scale modeling and understanding of materials have made remarkable progress, but they are still fundamentally limited by the large computational cost of explicit electronic-structure methods such as density-functional theory. This Progress Report shows how machine learning (ML) is currently enabling a new degree of realism in materials modeling: by \"learning\" electronic-structure data, ML-based interatomic potentials give access to atomistic simulations that reach similar accuracy levels but are orders of magnitude faster. A brief introduction to the new tools is given, and then, applications to some select problems in materials science are highlighted: phase-change materials for memory devices; nanoparticle catalysts; and carbon-based electrodes for chemical sensing, supercapacitors, and batteries. It is hoped that the present work will inspire the development and wider use of ML-based interatomic potentials in diverse areas of materials research.",

            "abstract": "Purpose Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Originality/value The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.",

Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre-surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.",

The biggest driver is the rapid improvement in computer technology which greatly increases the number of factors that can be considered during the design process. Thus, some of the key future directions lie in integrating the design process with other aspects of process systems engineering, such as scheduling, planning, control, and supply chain management. In addition, sustainability is now a major consideration.

            "abstract": "Receiving feedback from neural activity, dubbed neurofeedback, can reinforce brain self-regulation. In a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, healthy participants received amygdala neurofeedback via a visual brain-computer interface. The brain response to signals of reward and failure was modeled. In contrast to previous analyses, we take into account feedback that immediately preceded these signals. That means we tested whether responses were modulated while participants observed sequent reward and failure signals. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) showed a negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response to failure signals, when they were preceded by more failure signals. When failure signals were preceded by reward, in contrast, the response was less pronounced. The results suggest weighted processing of neurofeedback value in the OFC. Learning to self-regulate the brain with neurofeedback may involve similar neural networks as the learning of goal-directed action.",

            "abstract": "Plants are fundamentally important to life. Key research areas in plant science include plant species identification, weed classification using hyper spectral images, monitoring plant health and tracing leaf growth, and the semantic interpretation of leaf information. Botanists easily identify plant species by discriminating between the shape of the leaf, tip, base, leaf margin and leaf vein, as well as the texture of the leaf and the arrangement of leaflets of compound leaves. Because of the increasing demand for experts and calls for biodiversity, there is a need for intelligent systems that recognize and characterize leaves so as to scrutinize a particular species, the diseases that affect them, the pattern of leaf growth, and so on. We review several image processing methods in the feature extraction of leaves, given that feature extraction is a crucial technique in computer vision. As computers cannot comprehend images, they are required to be converted into features by individually analyzing image shapes, colors, textures and moments. Images that look the same may deviate in terms of geometric and photometric variations. In our study, we also discuss certain machine learning classifiers for an analysis of different species of leaves.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Writer identification is a challenging move in the field of pattern recognition and reflects advanced perceptions into the handwriting research. It is the process of determining the author or writer of the text by matching it with the training database. It is an exigent task because the writing style of an individual is distinct from other because of unique intrinsic characteristics and is different even if the same writer writes that text with the same pen next time. It is concerned with the writing styles, feelings, perception, behavior and the brain of an individual and it is one of the neoteric applications of biometric identification. Biometric identification is the branch of computer science that deals with identification of an individual from a group using unique identifiers such as fingerprints, retina, handwriting and signatures. It is a term used for the body measurements and calculations. This paper presents a comprehensive and transparent panorama on the work done for the writer identification system on different Indic and non-Indic scripts and a widespread view towards this peculiar research area. The structure of the paper comprises introduction, motivation for the work, background, sources of information, schemes, process, reported works, synthesis analysis, study of features and classifiers for writer identification, and finally the conclusion and future directions. The main focus of this paper is to present in a systematic way, the reported works on writer identification systems on Indic scripts such as Bengali, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu and Non-Indic scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Persian, Roman and finally exposes the synthesis analysis based on the findings. This study gives the cognizance and beneficial assistance to the novice researchers in this field by providing in a nut shell the studies of various feature extraction methods and classification techniques required for writer identification on both Indic and non-Indic scripts. It is observed that work done on the writer identification systems with good accuracy rates in Indic scripts is limited as compared to non-Indic scripts and truly presents a future direction.",

            "abstract": "Background: The investigation and knowledge of calcium handling mechanisms in the plasmodium has been considered as a potential biological target against malaria. Objective: This study deals with the evaluation of inhibitory activity of secondary metabolites of ethylacetate partitioned-fraction of Adansonia digitata stem bark extract on malaria-associated protein using in silico docking studies. Materials and methods: Molecular docking and virtual screening was performed to understand the mechanism of ligand binding and to identify potent calcium transporter inhibitors. The stem bark extracts of A. digitata contains rich sources of phytochemicals. The secondary metabolites were determined by HPLC-DAD and HRGC-MS analysis. The major chemical constituent present in the ethylacetate partitioned-fraction of A. digitata stem bark extract were examined for their antiplasmodial activity and were also involved in docking study. Results: The secondary metabolites, quercetin and apigenin inhibited the formation of beta-hematin. The results showed that all the selected compounds in the A. digitata showed binding energy ranging between -6.5 kcal/mol and -7.1 kcal/mol. Among the two chemical constituents, apigenin has the highest docking score along with the highest number of hydrogen bonds formed when compared to quercetin.

            "abstract": "Structural and vibrational properties of free base, cationic and hydrochloride species derived from both S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of antihistaminic promethazine (PTZ) agent have been theoretically evaluated in gas phase and in aqueous solution by using the hybrid B3LYP/6-31G* calculations. The initial structures of S(-) and R(+) enantiomers of hydrochloride PTZ were those polymorphic forms 1 and 2 experimentally determined by X-ray diffraction. Here, all structures in aqueous solution were optimized at the same level of theory by using the polarized continuum (PCM) and the universal solvation model. As was experimentally reported, variations in the unit cell lead to slight energy, density, and melting point differences between the two forms but, this behavior is not carried through in isotropic condition, like in solution with non-chiral solvents. Hence, the N-C distances, Mulliken, atomic natural population (NPA) and Merz-Kollman (MK) charges, bond orders, stabilization and solvation energies, frontier orbitals, some descriptors and their topological properties were compared with the antihistaminic cyclizine agent. The frontier orbitals studies show that the free base species of both forms in solution are more reactive than cyclizine. Higher electrophilicity indexes are observed in the cationic and hydrochloride species of PTZ than cyclizine while the cationic species of cyclizine have higher nucleophilicity index than both species of PTZ. The presences of bands attributed to cationic species of both enantiomers are clearly supported by the infrared and Raman spectra in the solid phase. The expected 114, 117 and 120 vibration normal modes for the free base, cationic and hydrochloride species of both forms were completely assigned and the force constants reported. Reasonable concordances among the predicted infrared, Raman, UV-Vis and Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD) with the corresponding experimental ones were found.",

However, sensors data suffers from uncertainty and unreliability due to acquisition errors or incomplete knowledge. This paper presents a new heterogeneous sensors data fusion method for binary occupancy detection which detects whether the place is occupied or not. This method is based on using neutrosophic sets and sensors data correlations. By using neutrosophic sets, uncertain data can be handled. Using sensors data fusion, on the other hand, increases the reliability by depending on more than one sensor data. Accordingly, the results of experiments applied using Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and FUzzy GEnetic (FUGE) algorithms prove the new method to enhance detection accuracy.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Introduction Results from recent studies have suggested a role for protease inhibitors in altering mechanisms involved in the initiation and proliferation of cancer cells. One such inhibitor, indinavir, may act as an anti-cancer agent by modulating the alpha-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a pro-carcinogenic protein that has been researched in conjunction with nicotine in lung cancer development. In our study, we compare indinavir's binding affinity towards alpha 7-nAchR and MMP-2, another promoter of malignancy, to determine what extracellular effects the drug has before being internalized to inhibit HIV-1 protease. Methods: A computer program, PyRx, was used to compare indinavir's binding affinity with digital models for alpha 7-nAchR, MMP-2 and HIV-1 protease, which were then compared to the results of in vitro binding assays for these targets. Results: PyRx testing predicted the highest binding affinity values for indinavir to MMP-2 (mean = 8.77 kcal/mol, S.D. = 0.29), followed by the alpha 7-nAchR (mean = 8.53 kcal/mol, S.D. = 0.15) and HIV-1 protease (mean = 7.5 kcal/mol, S.D. = 0.44). In vitro, indinavir's mean percent inhibition of control values were 103.2 for HIV-1 protease, 5.3 for MMP-2, and 7.7 for the alpha 7-nAchR. Conclusions: Binding affinity values for indinavir to MMP-2 and alpha 7-nAchR were not significantly different. Using PyRx to predict affinity compared with in vitro testing did not yield comparable results. However, indinavir was shown to slightly inhibit both alpha 7-nAchR and MMP-2, which may have ramifications in the drug's delivery to the intracellularly located HIV-1 protease.",

For such products, it is significant to investigate users' expectations related to cultural aspects to achieve user acceptance as broad as possible in all relevant countries. The researchers of the current study examined whether the cultural background of an individual has an influence on the subjective importance of user experience (UX) aspects for several common product categories. The researchers compared findings from a previous study conducted in Germany and a replication study carried out in Indonesia. Results show significant differences concerning the rated importance of UX aspects for many product categories. However, a detailed analysis of the results also shows that the impact of culture is considerably lower than the impact of interindividual differences between persons of the same culture. In addition, both samples show quite similar rankings of the importance of UX aspects. Thus, the product type has a much bigger impact than cultural differences.",

            "language": "Russian",
            "abstract": "Wikipedia is the fullest online open source encyclopedia, even more, it is multi-language; the work on its content is fundamentally based on principally new methods of distant group cooperation. One of the most characteristic patterns in preparation of new items in encyclopedia is the participation of competent volunteers who are able to describe the knowledge base which is dynamically developing, while the publishers of diverse other encyclopedias traditionally invite acknowledged licensed experts to prepare the items within their narrow fields of competence. Unlike this tradition, the administrators of Wikipedia rely on human capital, namely on the unclaimed (earlier) competence of thousands of people who do not call themselves experts but are eager to share information, work out rules of joint authorship and editing, make technical corrections of the encyclopedia items - and devote significant part of their life to this hobby-like activity. That is why up-to-day analysis of this experience as well as a review of multidisciplinary investigations, held mostly within science studies, sociology or computer studies, is highly important for psychologists. The paper presents a systematic review of the first-priority academic studies related to the experience of wikipedians. For example, the structural differentiation of Wikipedia as a dissipative adhocracy system is shown as a sort of folksonomy: the would-be authors first adapt and after that start their enlightening activity through mechanisms of self-actualization and self- transcendence which are believed to characterize the wikipedians' own values and meanings. The analysis of processes of cumulation, reworking and keeping actual knowledge are profound for studies of the so-called transactive memory. The wisdom of crowd phenomenon is analyzed in the context of gaining a declared consensus while the participating wikipedians are antagonistic from the point of their cognitive dissimilarity. That is why neither quality nor safety of the Wikipedia information are comparable to the most highly qualified encyclopedias, such as the British Encyclopedia which are known to recruit the most well-known experts. We may conclude that to rely on competent volunteers' participation means to be pragmatic, taking into consideration mechanisms of collective intelligence and collective thinking, which characterize the current state of the modem digital society. The analysis of the wikipedians' motivation shows that it is often based on reciprocal altruism as well as other intrinsic motives, being opposed to extrinsic ones. When destructive Wikipedia related activity, such as vandalism, is found, it is usually taken as a deviant behavior, neighboring to the elements of the \"dark triad\" (i.e. psychopathy, narcissism or machiavellianism). The final conclusion says that the study of the specifics of the wikipedians' personal traits and their prosocial behavior sufficiently enlarges the frontiers of current research in psychology.",

Large amounts of computational tools are available for data analysis. Additionally, many workflow management systems to piece together such tools into data analysis pipelines have been developed. For example, more than 50 computational tools for read mapping are available representing a large amount of duplicated effort. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these tools are correct and only a few have a user base large enough to have encountered and reported most of the potential problems. Bringing together many largely untested tools in a computational pipeline must lead to unpredictable results. Yet, this is the current state. While presently data analysis is performed on personal computers/workstations/clusters, the future will see development and analysis shift to the cloud. None of the workflow management systems is ready for this transition. This presents the opportunity to build a new system, which will overcome current duplications of effort, introduce proper testing, allow for development and analysis in public and private clouds, and include reporting features leading to interactive documents.",

For a symmetric submodular system (V, f) we construct a suitable sequence of vertical bar V vertical bar - 1 pendant pairs of its contractions. By using this sequence, we present some properties of the system and its contractions. Finally, we prove some results about the minimizers of a posimodular function.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "First-order logic is an important part of mathematical logic, and automated theorem proving is an interdisciplinary field of mathematics and computer science. The paper presents an automated theorem prover for first-order logic, called CSE_E 1.0, which is a combination of two provers contradiction separation extension (CSE) and E, where CSE is based on the recently-introduced multi-clause standard contradiction separation (S-CS) calculus for first-order logic and E is the well-known equational theorem prover for first-order logic based on superposition and rewriting. The motivation of the combined prover CSE_E 1.0 is to (1) evaluate the capability, applicability and generality of CSE_E, and (2) take advantage of novel multi-clause S-CS dynamic deduction of CSE and mature equality handling of E to solve more and harder problems. In contrast to other improvements of E, CSE_E 1.0 optimizes E mainly from the inference mechanism aspect. The focus of the present work is given to the description of CSE_E including its S-CS rule, heuristic strategies, and the S-CS dynamic deduction algorithm for implementation. In terms of combination, in order not to lose the capability of E and use CSE_E to solve some hard problems which are unsolved by E, CSE_E 1.0 schedules the running of the two provers in time. It runs plain E first, and if E does not find a proof, it runs plain CSE, then if it does not find a proof, some clauses inferred in the CSE run as lemmas are added to the original clause set and the combined clause set handed back to E for further proof search. CSE_E 1.0 is evaluated through benchmarks, e.g., CASC-26 (2017) and CASC-J9 (2018) competition problems (FOFdivision). Experimental results show that CSE_E 1.0 indeed enhances the performance of E to a certain extent.",

This paper demonstrates how STEAM learners, rather than computer scientists, can use AI to predictively simulate how concrete mixture inputs might affect the output of compressive strength under different conditions (e.g., lack of water and/or cement, or different concrete compressive strengths required for art creations). To help STEAM learners envision how AI can assist them in human-centric reasoning, two AI-based approaches will be illustrated: first, a Naive Bayes approach for supervised machine-learning of the dataset, which assumes no direct relations between the mixture components; and second, a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to machine-learn the same dataset for possible relations between the mixture components. These AI-based approaches enable controlled experiments to be conducted in-silico, where selected parameters could be held constant, while others could be changed to simulate hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios. In applying AI to think discursively, AI-Thinking can be educed from the STEAM learners, thereby improving their AI literacy, which in turn enables them to ask better questions to solve problems.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, it has been pointed out that teaching programming is a strong strategy to develop pupils' competences in computational thinking (CT). In the Portuguese context, the curriculum changes in 2018 made programming and CT compulsory for every pupil in primary and secondary education. Nowadays, there is an information and communication technology (ICT) subject, taught by a computer science teacher in each school grade. In Portugal, to become a computer science teacher in primary and secondary education, it is compulsory to have a master's degree in computer science education. This article reports on a pedagogical activity developed with student-teachers of a Master in Teaching Informatics at the University of Lisbon. Within the activities of the master's program, we developed a cross-analysis of the core characteristics of 26 block-based and visual programming applications (apps) used to teach computational thinking and programming in school classes. In order to organize the analysis, a framework with several dimensions was developed and used by student-teachers to register the characteristics of each app. The product of this work is a comparative matrix mapping the core characteristics of each of the 26 apps that student-teachers used to select the most appropriate one for teaching programming and computational thinking according to each grade, age group and other characteristics.",

It draws upon both the experience of a number of digital projects and research into the many-faceted concept of uncertainty in data, and in particular, it explores the conflicting strategies for the management of uncertainty in historical research processes that are reflected in the historiographical and digital humanities literature. Its intention is to support a dialogue between the humanities and computer science, able to realise the promise of digital humanities without a reversion to a new positivism in disciplines such as history and literary studies and it therefore concludes with recommendations for the developers of research tools and environments for digital history.",

            "abstract": "Building fire is a complex geographic process related to the indoor spatial environment, a smart spatial data model can accurately describe the spatial-temporal information of a building fire scene, which is important for modeling a fire process. With the development of fire dynamics and computer science, many building fire models have been proposed and widely used. However, the spatial representation of these models is relatively weak. In this study, a fire process modeled via the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and the requirements of a spatial data model are initially analyzed. Then, a new spatial data model named the Combinatorial Spatial Data Model (CSDM) is combined with Geographic Information System (GIS). The key features of the CSDM, which include spatial, semantic, topological, event and state representations of a building fire scene modeled via the CSDM are subsequently presented. In addition, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagram of the CSDM is also presented, and then experiments with a simplified building are conducted as a CSDM implementation case. A method of transferring data from the CSDM to FDS and a building fire analysis approach using the CSDM are subsequently proposed.",

            "abstract": "The human quest to master the anatomy and physiology of living systems started as early as 1600 BC, with documents from the Greeks, Indians, and Romans presenting the earliest systematic studies and advances. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the progress slowed until the Renaissance renewed scientific interest in anatomy and physiology, ushering in an era of spectacular advances. Alongside the discoveries of modern science, innovations in media such as printing, photography and color reproduction, improved the accuracy of communicating science. Techniques for noninvasively viewing the human body, such as magnetic resonance imaging, opened up new ways of exploring and understanding anatomy, physiology, and disease pathogenesis. Advances in three-dimensional (3D)-technologies, including computer graphics and animation are directly linked to many advances in medicine and surgery. Anatomy education has come a long way from papyrus leaf inscriptions to computerized 3D modeling, holographic representation, and virtual reality-based software. The future presents unlimited options for studying and understanding anatomy as Google glasses, bioprinting, virtual reality, and allied technologies transform the world into a classroom. This review summarizes the journey of mankind to master anatomy and physiology.",

            "abstract": "Diminishing returns and advances in telecommunications have prompted large video game firms to seek new locations, outsource production, and develop niche studios, including on Canada's East Coast. In this paper, we examine emerging occupational cultures and trace the origins and evolution of video game production in Canada's Atlantic provinces-a critical yet peripheral space economy in the gaming sector. Our findings are drawn from 30 interviews with gameworkers, studio managers, government officials, and other industry experts. We find this industry to be driven by the confluence of three major factors: (i) provincial governments have supported video game development as a strategic industry via financial incentives; (ii) firms are benefiting from a return migration effect and are repatriating Atlantic Canadian talent from media hubs by selling \"home,\" work-life balance, and an alternative to the punishing gamework culture associated with Silicon Valley; and (iii) post-secondary institutions in the region have improved their talent pipelines through computer science, digital media, and video game development programs.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Web-based virtual reality (VR) development tools are in ubiquitous use by software developers, and now, university (undergraduate) students, to move beyond using, to creating new and energizing VR content. Web-based VR (WebVR), among other libraries and frameworks, have risen as a low-cost platform for users to create rich and intuitive VR content and applications. However, the success of WebVR as an instructional tool relies on post-secondary students technological acceptance (TA), the intersectionality of a user's perceived utility (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU, or convenience) with said technological tool. Yet, there is a dearth of exploratory studies of students' experiences with the AR/VR development technologies to infer their TA. To ascertain the viability of WebVR tools for software engineering undergraduates in the classroom, this paper presents a 3-case contextual investigation of 38 undergraduate students tasked with creating VR content. In each use case, students were provided increasing freedom in their VR content development parameters. Results indicated that students demonstrated elements of technological acceptance in their selection of webVR and other platforms, and not only successfully creating rich and robust VR content (PU), but also executing these projects in a short period (PEOU). Other positive externalities observed were students exhibitions of soft skills (e.g. creativity, critical thinking) and different modes of demonstrating coding knowledge, which suggest further study. Discussed are the lessons learned from the WebVR and VR/AR interventions and recommendations for WebVR instruction. This work may be helpful for both learners and teachers using VR/AR in selecting, designing, and developing coursework materials, tools, and libraries.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background and aims: Gambling education programs typically focus on promoting gambling as a high-risk activity with harmful effects; however, these programs demonstrate limited effects on the prevention of gambling problems. This paper proposes a clear theoretical framework to inform the content and delivery of gambling education initiatives and draws on psychological and pedagogical research to address some of the practical issues associated with its implementation. Methods: Literature was reviewed across fields of psychology, public health, and pedagogy to provide key recommendations to improve the outcomes of gambling education. Results: Four key recommendations were made for the development of future gambling education programs centering on theoretical approach, specialized content, and delivery. Discussion and conclusions: Recommended advancements are as follows: (a) evidence suggests shifting away from messages about gambling harms and instead applying a cognitive-developmental framework of problem gambling that may improve youth engagement by increasing personal relevance. (b) The cognitive model of problem gambling suggests that misconceptions about the profitability of gambling games (e.g., the gambler's fallacy) play an important role in the development of problems and should be a key target for education. However, exposing such misconceptions requires the challenge of teaching the mathematical principles that underpin them. (c) The pedagogical field provides valuable insights into teaching complex concepts. Research that applies the conceptual change model to science education suggests misconceptions also facilitate learning new complex information, such as gambling-related mathematical concepts (i.e., randomness and statistics). (d) In addition, improvements in computer-assisted teaching methods provide opportunities to use simulations and visualizations to help teach abstract concepts and correct such misconceptions.",

The articles are discussed through the prism of design science research that originates in engineering and computer science. In contrast with natural and social sciences that aim to develop and test theories about the world, the objective of design science is to create new artifacts that are useful for solving important practical problems. In audit research, design science methodology was originally used implicitly in early studies devoted to developing and evaluating audit analytical procedures and audit sampling techniques. The recent advances in information technology necessitate renewed attention to this research methodology especially given the profound changes in accounting, auditing, and business processes currently underway.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to provide guidelines for the development of online learning communities for educational institutions in order to promote STEM education. The information presented is based on the study of STEM instruction and a professional learning community (PLC) of 17 primary school teachers from 6 private schools in Thailand. In each school, semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers responsible for science, mathematics and technology instruction. Technology refers to computer, design and technology courses. In addition, there were 9 expert interviews, including STEM, computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and online learning communities, and lesson study concepts. The results of qualitative analysis found that three points about the development of an online PLC in schools to promote STEM teaching should be considered: 1. Individual means a member who will participate in an online PLC, including support staff such as school administrators and technical staff. 2. Information technology refers to a system or tools that can be used as a medium for exchanging knowledge gained from learning among members. 3. Content refers to the structuring of the content displayed in the online learning community and the scheduling of members' activities. Therefore, all these must be considered in the planning of online PLC development that allows members to interact and communicate through the use of CSCL tools, which will lead to the exchange of learning and help among members such as analyzing contents that can be used to link subjects or considering a theme used for STEM instructional design.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "the need for a reliable and complementary identifier mechanism in a digital forensic analysis is the focus of this study. Mouse dynamics have been applied in information security studies, particularly, continuous authentication and authorization. However, the method applied in security is void of specific behavioral signature of a user, which inhibits its applicability in digital forensic science. This study investigated the likelihood of the observation of a unique signature from mouse dynamics of a computer user. An initial mouse path model was developed using non-finite automata. Thereafter, a set-theory based adaptive two-stage hash function and a multi-stage rule-based semantic algorithm were developed to observe the feasibility of a unique signature for forensic usage. An experimental process which comprises three existing mouse dynamics datasets were used to evaluate the applicability of the developed mechanism. The result showed a low likelihood of extracting unique behavioral signature which can be used in a user attribution process. Whilst digital forensic readiness mechanism could be a potential approach that can be used to achieve a reliable behavioral biometrics modality, the lack of unique signature presents a limitation. In addition, the result supports the logic that the current state of behavioral biometric modality, particularly mouse dynamics, is not suitable for forensic usage. Hence, the study concluded that whilst mouse dynamics-based behavioral biometrics may be a complementary modality in security studies, more will be required to adopt it as a forensic modality in litigation. Furthermore, the result from this study finds relevance in other human attributional studies such as user identification in recommender systems, e-commerce, and online profiling systems, where the degree of accuracy is not relatively high.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Neurosciences and neurotechnologies (from now on called neuro-advancements) constantly evolve and influence all facets of society. Neuroethics and neuro-governance discourses focus on the impact of neuro-advancements on individuals and society, and stakeholder involvement is identified as an important aspect of being able to deal with such an impact. Nurses engage with neuro-advancements within their occupation, including neuro-linked assistive technologies, such as brain-computer interfaces, cochlear implants, and virtual reality. The role of nurses is multifaceted and includes being providers of clinical and other health services, educators, advocates for their field and their clients, including disabled people, researchers, and influencers of policy discourses. Nurses have a stake in how neuro-advancements are governed, therefore, being influencers of neuroethics and neuro-governance discourses should be one of these roles. Lifelong learning and professional development could be one mechanism to increase the knowledge of nurses about ethical, social, and legal issues linked to neuro-advancements, which in turn, would allow nurses to provide meaningful input towards neuro-advancement discussions. Disabled people are often the recipients of neuro-advancements and are clients of nurses, therefore, they have a stake in the way nurses interact with neuro-advancements and influence the sociotechnical context of neuro-advancements, which include neuro-linked assistive devices. We performed a scoping review to investigate the role of narrative around nurses in relation to neuro-advancements within academic literature and newspapers. We found minimal engagement with the role of nurses outside of clinical services. No article raised the issue of nurses having to be involved in neuro-ethics and neuro-governance discussions or how lifelong learning could be used to gain that competency. Few articles used the term assistive technology or assistive device and no article covered the engagement of nurses with disabled people within a socio-technical context. We submit that the role narrative falls short of what is expected from nurses and shows shortcomings at the intersection of nurses, socio-technical approaches to neuro-assistive technologies and other neuro-advancements and people with disabilities. Neuro-governance and neuroethic discourses could be a useful way for nurses and disabled people to co-shape the socio-technical context of neuro-advancements, including neuro-assistive technologies. Lifelong learning initiatives should be put in place to provide the knowledge necessary for nurses to take part in the neuroethics and neuro-governance discussion.",

            "title": "Crazy'App: A web survey on representations and attitudes toward mental disorders using video testimonies",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In the international context of efforts to combat the stigmatization of people with mental health problems, representations and attitudes about these illnesses have not to date been widely investigated in France. However, new technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to collect such information on a large scale and to deploy more efficient action against stigma. Objectives. - The Crazy'App survey was designed as an instrument for studying potentially stigmatizing representations and attitudes towards mental disorders. It asks respondents to react, rather than to standard diagnostic labels or case vignettes, to video testimonies by people with different mental disorders talking about their experiences. Methods. - The web survey was made available on smartphone or computer and advertised on various media and during a French exhibition about mental disorders, mental health and well-being (\"Mental Desordre\", Cite des sciences, Paris, 2016). It consisted of short (<2 min) video testimonials by four people presenting respectively anorexia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction to alcohol. Each testimony was immediately followed by series of questions to which participants were to respond using visual analog scales. The questionnaires investigated different domains, such as the causes of each of these mental disorders, the possible treatments and the respondent's personal attitudes in hypothetical situations (e.g. working with the person seen in the video). After having completed the survey, respondents were offered an opportunity to compare their own responses to those of the other respondents, and watch expert psychiatrists interviews delivering clinical and scientific knowledge and sharing their own attitudes. Results. - The respondents (n = 2600) were young, mostly women, educated and concerned about the subject. They exhibited good knowledge of the disorders. They reported a multi-causal view of the etiologies, where psychological causes were rated higher than neurobiological causes (although less so for respondents reporting having had a mental disorder themselves), while other types of causes (environmental, spiritual, and nutritional) received much lower ratings. Respondents also expressed high potential social proximity, but this result varied according to the type of disorder, in particular, the social distance and the perception of dangerousness were greater for addiction and bipolar disorder. Conclusions. - Crazy'App operationalizes emerging strategies in the efforts to combat stigma, implementing what is known as a \"contact based intervention\" in English-speaking countries. While it does not erase the differences in attitudes observed from one pathology to another, this type of survey -intervention based on video testimonies could help to reduce the desire for social distancing from people with mental disorders, even in a particularly sensitized and informed population. Multimedia technologies are an efficient way to offer rich, potentially interactive content better able to embody people and their actual experiences than clinical descriptions or even life narratives. However the use of videos could put the focus on the individual characteristics (physical, gestural, verbal, nonverbal. . .), and this should be cautiously taken into account according to the anti-stigma objectives. Connected technologies also make it possible to enhance the more classic de-stigmatization actions focused on the deconstruction of preconceived ideas, making the action more participatory, while simultaneously assessing their efficacy. By mediating contact with individuals and behaviors perceived as deviant, the aim would be to develop psycho-social skills and concrete abilities for action in the general population, to include people with mental disorders in the community.

            "title": "A Novel Hybrid Genetic-Whale Optimization Model for Ontology Learning from Arabic Text",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Ontologies are used to model knowledge in several domains of interest, such as the biomedical domain. Conceptualization is the basic task for ontology building. Concepts are identified, and then they are linked through their semantic relationships. Recently, ontologies have constituted a crucial part of modern semantic webs because they can convert a web of documents into a web of things. Although ontology learning generally occupies a large space in computer science, Arabic ontology learning, in particular, is underdeveloped due to the Arabic language's nature as well as the profundity required in this domain. The previously published research on Arabic ontology learning from text falls into three categories: developing manually hand-crafted rules, using ordinary supervised/unsupervised machine learning algorithms, or a hybrid of these two approaches. The model proposed in this work contributes to Arabic ontology learning in two ways. First, a text mining algorithm is proposed for extracting concepts and their semantic relations from text documents. The algorithm calculates the concept frequency weights using the term frequency weights. Then, it calculates the weights of concept similarity using the information of the ontology structure, involving (1) the concept's path distance, (2) the concept's distribution layer, and (3) the mutual parent concept's distribution layer. Then, feature mapping is performed by assigning the concepts' similarities to the concept features. Second, a hybrid genetic-whale optimization algorithm was proposed to optimize ontology learning from Arabic text. The operator of the G-WOA is a hybrid operator integrating GA's mutation, crossover, and selection processes with the WOA's processes (encircling prey, attacking of bubble-net, and searching for prey) to fulfill the balance between both exploitation and exploration, and to find the solutions that exhibit the highest fitness. For evaluating the performance of the ontology learning approach, extensive comparisons are conducted using different Arabic corpora and bio-inspired optimization algorithms. Furthermore, two publicly available non-Arabic corpora are used to compare the efficiency of the proposed approach with those of other languages. The results reveal that the proposed genetic-whale optimization algorithm outperforms the other compared algorithms across all the Arabic corpora in terms of precision, recall, and F-score measures. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of ontology learning from Arabic and non-Arabic texts in terms of these three measures.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The brain is a complex organ operating on multiple scales. From molecular events that inform electrical and biochemical cellular responses, the brain interconnects processes all the way up to the massive network size of billions of brain cells. This strongly coupled, nonlinear, system has been subject to research that has turned increasingly multidisciplinary. The seminal work of Hodgkin and Huxley in the 1950s made use of experimental data to derive a coherent physical model of electrical signaling in neurons, which can be solved using mathematical and computational methods, thus bringing together neuroscience, physics, mathematics, and computer science. Over the last decades numerous projects have been dedicated to modeling and simulation of specific parts of molecular dynamics, neuronal signaling, and neural network behavior. Simulators have been developed around a specific objective and scale, in order to cope with the underlying computational complexity. Often times a dimension reduction approach allows larger scale simulations, this however has the inherent drawback of losing insight into structure-function interplay at the cellular level. This paper gives an overview of the project NeuroBox that has the objective of integrating multiple brain scales and associated physical models into one unified framework. NeuroBox hosts geometry and anatomical reconstruction methods, such that detailed three-dimensional domains can be integrated into numerical simulations of models based on partial differential equations. The project further focusses on deriving numerical methods for handling complex computational domains, and to couple multiple spatial dimensions. The latter allows the user to specify in which parts of the biological problem high-dimensional representations are necessary and where low-dimensional approximations are acceptable. NeuroBox offers workflow user interfaces that are automatically generated with VRL-Studio and can be controlled by non-experts. The project further uses uG4 as the numerical backend, and therefore accesses highly advanced discretization methods as well as hierarchical and scalable numerical solvers for very large neurobiological problems.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Online romance scams defraud dating website users of large amounts of money and inflict serious psychological harm. Victims of these scams often blame themselves for their losses and are blamed by others. We consider whether victims actually do share responsibility with the scammer for their losses. Three sorts of cases are particularly relevant: (i) where there are relatively many abortive meetings and even more fruitless money transfers in a single scam; (ii) where someone is a repeat scam victim; and (iii) where the victim has been warned by authorities that they are currently a victim of a scam and pay anyway. We argue that responsibility sometimes is shared, but that losses can be out of proportion to imprudence. Scam victims sometimes violate epistemic norms, but in ways that are peculiar to romantic attachment. The paper combines the methods of qualitative psychological research on scam victims and analytic philosophy (Research for this paper was supported by Grant EP/N028112/1 from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council).",

            "abstract": "A method is developed for predicting the sorption parameters of polymers (the infinite dilution solubility coefficient of gases S and the Henry law equilibrium constant k(D) of double sorption models) of most light gases in glassy polymers on the basis of a computer model of a polymer chain segment. From the molecular dynamic model of conformations of a short (about 200-600 atoms) segment of the polymer chain, the dependences of a number of geometric indices, such as the accessible surface area and the accessible surface area with a positive partial charge, on the probe radius (in fact, on the effective radius of penetrant or sorbate) are calculated. The linear approximation coefficients of these dependences are used as explanatory variables in multiple linear regression. Significant variables and their weights in regression are determined on the basis of experimental measurements from the Database of Physicochemical Properties of Polymers of the Laboratory of Membrane Gas Separation at the Institute of Petrochemical Synthesis, Russian Academy of Sciences. By using a more accurate algorithm for calculating the areas of macromolecules, the shortcomings of the first version of this method are eliminated. For S, the coefficient of regression determination (adjusted R-2) on the test sample is equal to 0.8 (this corresponds to an average relative error of 77% in predicting S, which is considered good accuracy), and for k(D), the coefficient of determination is 0.81 and the average relative error is 47%, which is also a good result considering large (up to decimal order) errors of the experimental measurements of S and k(D).",

            "abstract": "Background: Patient safety is a priority of any healthcare system, and one of the most effective measures is hand hygiene. For this, it is important that health staff have correct adherence and perform the technique properly. Otherwise, the incidence of nosocomial infections can increase, with consequent complications. The aim here was to analyze hand hygiene training and the effectiveness of different methods and educational strategies among nurses and whether they maintained correct adherence over time. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in the sources CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Dialnet, Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), ProQuest (Proquest Health and Medical Complete), Medline, SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), and Scopus. The search equation with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors was \"Nurs* AND (handwashing OR hand hygiene) AND clinical trial\". The review was performed following the recommendations of the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: n = 17 clinical trials were included, with a total of 5747 nurses and nursing students. Strategies such as reminder sounds, practical simulations, videos, and audiovisual media improved handwashing compliance. Adherence overtime increased by up to 60%. The greatest effectiveness was related to the use of povidone-iodine, which reduced colony formation compared Hand hygiene teaching strategies among nursing staff : a systematic review to soap. Conclusions: The strategies that go beyond teaching techniques such as lectures may be more effective at increasing hand hygiene compliance. Combined approaches to learning/instruction improve user satisfaction by enabling self-management, flexibility, and repetition.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to manifest the intellectual and cognitive structure of CORINE Land Cover (CLC) research applications. Data from the Web of Science (WoS) was used to delimit publication on CLC during the period from 1985 until 2019 (29th April), retrieving a total of 873 documents. Through author citations, the origins and the most influential papers were identified. The main lines of research were identified from word co-occurrences extracted from the titles, keywords, and abstracts of the papers. In the view of both structures, it can be concluded that CORINE land cover constitutes a relatively young set of scientific data, with a constant expansion and a strongly interdisciplinary structure. The development of this application is dependent on the knowledge of such research areas as geography, remote sensing, ecology, forestry, agriculture, engineering, optics, and/or computer science. We believe that this information could be very useful for CLC users, as it reflects a large-scale analysis of the research lines of CLC and illuminates how research has changed over time in diverse areas of applications. Moreover, this study is intended to offer a useful tool for the CLC scientific community, showcasing the main research lines and the most noteworthy papers. Finally, the methodology used in this study can be replicated in many other fields of science to explore its intellectual and cognitive structure.",

            "abstract": "The data provenance can be understood as the record describing people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in the production, influence, or delivery of a data or object. Information security is intended to preserve the set of information that represents value for individuals, organizations or entities. From this perspective, this research analyzes and identifies the interdisciplinary relationships between data origin and information security in the field of Information Science. It is a research of a basic nature, characterized by an exploratory and qualitative approach. With the study carried out it is observed that the provenance of data by itself does not guarantee the confidentiality, the integrity and the necessary availability in the course of its processes and that the properties of the information security contribute in a significant way for this. Likewise, the provenance of data can be considered an important requirement to establish reliability and provide security in computer information systems.",

            "abstract": "The interplay between Geographical Information System (GIS) and Computer Science has continued to yield improved methods of carrying out many surveying-related activities. In the past, survey control points were stored in file systems and at the best in Database Management applications thereby leading to the limited usage of the survey control points since they are difficult to locate in the field. This study however, suggests another approach for the storage of these survey control points which makes them to be easily accessible and gives room for faster update and geo-visualization of the survey control points. This was achieved by means of web programming applications such as Node-JS, Leaflet Javascript Mapping API, MONGODB, HTML and CSS, integrating GIS into web technologies. The end product is an interactive web application that can be accessed using any smart device with the control points rendered on the user interface. The Survey Control Finder application (E-Beacon) is a WebGIS platform for the geovisualisation of survey control stations in the University of Nigeria, Enugu campus (UNEC), Nigeria. This study gives insight into what the latest trend in technology has in store for surveying and the need to arouse the interest of learners in web application programming in order to develop more surveying-related applications.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Many process control problems with complex qualitative specifications cannot be addressed via conventional control design methods. Examples of such specifications include logic specifications expressed in the design of start-up, shut-down, changeover, and emergency shutdown operating procedures. In recent years, it has been shown in the control systems and computer science communities that symbolic models provide convenient and powerful mechanisms to synthesize controllers enforcing such qualitative specifications. The use of symbolic models reduces the synthesis of the controllers to a fixed-point computation problem over a finite-state abstract system. In this paper, after explaining the notion of approximate bisimulation for incrementally globally asymptotically stable (delta-GAS) nonlinear control systems, the construction of approximately bisimilar symbolic models for such systems is presented. Then synthesis of time-optimal symbolic controller for this class of systems is performed based on results from the computer science literature. As a benchmark chemical process control problem, an approximately bisimilar symbolic model is constructed for a safe changeover process. Then a symbolic controller is designed and it is refined to a controller to be applied to the original process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the symbolic controller. Although the construction of the symbolic model may be complex, the synthesis of the controller in a finite-state space is fast and most importantly the error bounds are adjustable as design parameters.

            "abstract": "We present a methodology for solution reproducibility for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model during its ongoing software infrastructure development to prepare for exascale computers. The nonlinear chaotic nature of climate system simulations precludes traditional model verification approaches since machine precision differences-resulting from code refactoring, changes in software environment, and so on-grow exponentially to a different weather state. Here, we leverage the nature of climate as a statistical description of the atmosphere in order to establish model reproducibility. We evaluate the degree to which two-sample equality of distribution tests can confidently detect the change in climate from minor tuning parameter changes on model output variables in order to establish the level of difference that indicates a new climate. To apply this (baselined test), we target a section of the model's development cycle wherein no intentional science changes have been applied to its source code. We compare an ensemble of short simulations that were conducted using a verified model configuration against a new ensemble with the same configuration but with the latest software infrastructure (Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth, CIME5.0), compiler versions, and software libraries. We also compare these against ensemble simulations conducted using the original version of the software infrastructure (CIME4.0) of the earlier model configuration, but with the latest compilers and software libraries, to test the impact of new compilers and libraries in isolation from additional software infrastructure. The two-sample equality of distribution tests indicates that these ensembles indeed represent the same climate.",

            "abstract": "Education in the natural and engineering sciences is traditionally taught following a standard template where the instructor stands in front of the classroom presenting statically and linearly the course material. The educational environment can be improved by using innovative didactic concepts with interactive-digital tools that enhance the students' understanding of the material. Audience response systems promote active learning during lectures, and learning management systems improve students' self-learning strategies. This contribution demonstrates such adaptations for the lecture series \"Groundwater Management with Computer Models\" and shares our experiences regarding methods, effort, and benefit. Student performance was significantly improved together with overall positive evaluation. The techniques used for redesign also increase the teaching efficiency because they exhibit a large degree of reusability without significant modifications and are well scalable for larger audiences. In addition, media-enhanced lecture series meet future requirements by students and the industry for higher education in a networked and digitized society.",

Quality of service (QoS) can play an important role in wireless computer networks as it can facilitate evaluation of their performance and can provide mechanisms to improve their operation. In this study probabilistic neural network (PNN) and Bayesian classification were developed to process delay, jitter and percentage packet loss ratio for VoIP traffic. Both methods successfully categorized the transmission of VoIP packets into low, medium and high QoS categories but overall the Bayesian approach performed more accurately than PNN. By accurately determining the network's QoS, an improved understanding of its performance is obtained. (C) 2018 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS).

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The ability to define accurate linear models to find patterns or relationships between variables is one of the most challenging fields in Computer Science. In particular, extrapolative applications are widely used to predict values in Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences. Analysts usually focus on reducing the approximation error in order to ensure fairly reliable predictions. Using pattern detection models such as Multilayer Artificial Neural Networks can offer good results in predicting possible outcomes, however they might not be the optimal fit for predicting evolutionary trends due to their inherent overfitting characteristics. Regression models, on the other hand are more often used to predict trending behaviors and therefore they can be more helpful when studying the evolution of a given instrument, symbol or series. However, a simple regression model can be very inaccurate with an unacceptable prediction error rate. This paper shows an automatic method to find trends in known instruments, by using a massive linear regression technique combined with a conventional machine learning proposal that works on optimizing the weights of the linear regressive structures. In this paper the authors show an application of the model in finance (stocks market instruments), however the proposal is designed to work for to any discipline that studies the trends of any evolutionary object.

            "abstract": "Background/purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the marginal gaps of dental restorations manufactured using conventional loss wax and casting, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and 3D printing methods. Materials and methods: A zirconia master die model with an upper right first molar resin crown was prepared as a standardized model. A total of 30 resin master die models were duplicated from this standard model. Simultaneously, 10 Co-Cr-Mo metal crowns were individually obtained using the conventional loss wax and casting method (Group A), selective laser sintering (Group B), and CAD/CAM (Group C), respectively. The marginal gaps between the crowns fabricated conventional and digital methods with master die models were calculated using a 3D replica and mapping technique. Results: Statistical analyses revealed there were significant differences in the marginal gaps in the group A with group B and C (p < 0.05). The mean marginal gaps between dental crowns with die models were 76 +/- 61 mu m, 116 +/- 92 mu m, and 121 +/- 98 mu m for groups A, B, and C, respectively. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the marginal gaps were clinical acceptable in conventional and digital techniques. (C) 2019 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

This brief presents a neural computing hardware unit and a neuromorphic system architecture based on a modified leaky integrate and fire neuron model in a spiking neural network for a pattern recognition task in register-transfer level. The neuron model and the spiking network are explored, considering digital implementation, targeting low-cost high-speed large-scale systems. Results of the hardware synthesis and implementation on field-programmable gate array are presented as a proof of concept. Accordingly, the maximum frequency of the implemented neuron model and spiking network are 412.371 MHz and 189.071 MHz, respectively.",

This dialogue traces historic injustice and contemporary innovations that seek to resuscitate the landscape and the community in, through, and around modern legal and technological onto-epistemologies. At the cutting edge of contemporary technology, AI is using algorithms to aggregate and sift political communities online. Te Haumoana White's insights on land, environment, people and law are reflected on the AI tendency to advocate for the manipulation of popular opinion in the aggregation of AI algorithms. The computer science community who advocate AI seem to have little understanding of political theory, political economics outside the tired and outdated neoliberal paradigm, nor how voice constitutes politics. Thus, Tegmark and others in the AI genre, tend to advocate a 'benign dictatorship' model, based on a combination of neoliberalism and algorithms that are vulnerable to exacerbation and manipulation of popularist trends.",

While we enjoy the benefits and convenience that software programs provide, we cannot ignore issues with software reliability, complexity, and security. Since the introduction of complex networks, people have been using software network to analyze software problems; however, traditional software network models are not currently capable of analyzing software with large scale and complex structures. In this paper, a new software network model is proposed, with which each node in the network can be assigned a set of coordinates that reflect its function-call information and make the disorder of the network graph more orderly. Additionally, characteristics and derivatives of the model are thoroughly examined and analyzed. A case study using the coordinate model combined with bug information is then conducted to analyze five different software programs. The results show that the proposed model can be used to analyze the relationship between nodes or defects distribution and software network parameters, as well as high-risk module excavation through a defect density analysis. Compared to traditional software network models, the model maintains the inner logic relationship of the software systems better, which makes it easier to analyze many aspects of software.",

            "abstract": "The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is one of the most important lattice problems in computer science and cryptography. The LLL lattice basis reduction algorithm runs in polynomial time and can compute an LLL-reduced basis that provably contains an approximate solution to the SVP. On the other hand, the LLL algorithm in practice tends to solve low-dimensional exact SVPs with high probability, i.e., >99.9%. Filling this theoretical-practical gap would lead to an understanding of the computational hardness of the SVP. In this paper, we try to fill the gap in 3, 4 and 5 dimensions and obtain two results. First, we prove that given a 3, 4 or 5-dimensional LLL-reduced basis, the shortest vector is one of the basis vectors or it is a limited integer linear combination of the basis vectors. In particular, we construct explicit representations of the shortest vector by using the LLL-reduced basis. Our analysis yields a necessary and sufficient condition for checking whether the output of the LLL algorithm contains the shortest vector or not. Second, we estimate the failure probability that a 3-dimensional random LLL-reduced basis does not contain the shortest vector. The upper bound seems rather tight by comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation.",

Specifically the competitive ratio with respect to the monotone function f (c(1), . . . , c(k)) = (c(1) + . . . +c(k))/k is referred to as the arithmetic mean component competitive ratio. Hasegawa and Itoh derived the explicit representation of the arithmetic mean component competitive ratio for k = 2, but it has not been known for any integer k >= 3. In this paper, we derive the explicit representations of the arithmetic mean component competitive ratio for k = 3 and k = 4, respectively. On the other hand, we show that it is computationally difficult to derive the explicit representation of the arithmetic mean component competitive ratio for arbitrary integer k in a way similar to the cases for k = 2, 3, and 4.",

            "abstract": "Radiation education is necessary for a wide variety of people, such as radiation workers particularly for students of secondary school and higher education institution who learn radiation sciences. The fact that we could not see or feel radiation makes it difficult to understand it. The use of radiation trajectories shown on a personal computer should be useful to overcome this difficulty. In order to understand radiation behaviour inside the material, we have developed a Simu-Rad (Copyright: L Y2018002738) by using Monte Carlo simulation programme One who has no programming knowledge is able to simulate photons in a material through the developed programme The program could become a computer aided learning tool for radiation related courses. We aim to facilitate lecturer from 'The Traditional Classroom' to 'The Flipped Classroom' for radiation education concerning in the era of IR 4.0. To validate our radiation simulator, we calculate photon linear attenuation coefficient (mu) of an aluminium material which commonly used as a filter in diagnostic radiology. mu is one of the main characteristics to understand how the radiation attenuated inside the materials. We calculate at energy photon of 662 keV (Cs-137 radiation source) to compare our results of mu with the XCOM database. Consequently, the results from the developed simulator comparable with the database verified our programme to be used for radiation study.",

            "abstract": "Background The use of different imaging modalities to assist in skin cancer diagnosis is a common practice in clinical scenarios. Different features representative of the lesion under evaluation can be retrieved from image analysis and processing. However, the integration and understanding of these additional parameters can be a challenging task for physicians, so artificial intelligence (AI) methods can be implemented to assist in this process. This bibliographic research was performed with the goal of assessing the current applications of AI algorithms as an assistive tool in skin cancer diagnosis, based on information retrieved from different imaging modalities. Materials and methods The bibliography databases ISI Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus were used for the literature search, with the combination of keywords: skin cancer, skin neoplasm, imaging and classification methods. Results The search resulted in 526 publications, which underwent a screening process, considering the established eligibility criteria. After screening, only 65 were qualified for revision. Conclusion Different imaging modalities have already been coupled with AI methods, particularly dermoscopy for melanoma recognition. Learners based on support vector machines seem to be the preferred option. Future work should focus on image analysis, processing stages and image fusion assuring the best possible classification outcome.",

            "title": "Using computer-based cognitive mapping to improve students' divergent thinking for creativity development",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Creativity is increasingly considered to be an important goal of education. While creativity can be influenced by many noncognitive factors (eg, personality and motivation), creative thinking remains the most important source of creativity. Creative thinking combines several cognitive processes leading to the generation and selection of new and useful ideas or solutions. Divergent thinking or the ability to generate a range of alternative ideas, is a necessary component of creative thinking. Research has explored cognitive strategies to activate divergent thinking. However, such strategies are often abstract and difficult to implement. This study proposes a computer-based cognitive mapping approach to improving divergent thinking as a response to this challenge. The approach enables students to build a computer-based cognitive map that can foster divergent thinking by associating unrelated concept, object or situation (COS), by decomposing a COS into rich details for viewing it from divergent perspectives, and by combining and changing COSs. A quasi-experiment was conducted with high school students. The results have shown promising effects of the approach on improving students' performance and perceived competence in divergent thinking. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Divergent thinking is an important part of the cognitive processes that may lead to creativity. Divergent thinking can be enhanced by training in cognitive strategies, but these strategies involve complex cognitive processes that are abstract and difficult to implement. Cognitive mapping can facilitate complex thinking and cognitive processes. What this paper adds This study proposes a computer-based cognitive mapping approach as a divergent thinking tool that may help students visualize the process of applying divergent thinking strategies (association, decomposition, and combination and adjustment) when performing creativity-related tasks. The approach is effective in improving high school students' divergent thinking performance in terms of idea fluency, flexibility and originality, in addition to perceived competence in divergent thinking. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to provide learners with effective thinking tools that facilitate the complex cognitive processes of applying divergent thinking strategies. Divergent thinking processes can be facilitated by associating unrelated concept, object or situation (COS), by decomposing a COS into rich details for viewing it from divergent perspectives, and by combining and changing COSs.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can assist physicians in effective and efficient diagnostic decision-making. CAD systems are currently essential tools in some areas of clinical practice. In addition, it is one of the established fields of study in the interface of medicine and computer science. There are, however, still some critical challenges that CAD systems face. Methods: This paper first describes a new literature review protocol, the Dynamic PRISMA approach based on the well-known PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) approach. This new approach enhances the traditional approach by integrating a feedback mechanism module. As a result of the literature review, this paper identifies seven major challenges that occur today in CAD and inhibit the next major developments. Results: The seven challenges described in this paper involve some technical weaknesses in the interface of medicine and computer science. These challenges are related to various algorithmic limitations, the difficulty of medical professionals to adopt new systems, problems when dealing with patient data, and the lack of guidelines and standardization regarding many aspects of CAD. This paper also describes some of the recent research developments towards these challenges. Conclusion: If these seven key challenges are addressed properly, then the ways for dealing with them will become the R&D pillars needed to bring CAD to the next level. This would require additional well-coordinated collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the fields of medicine and computer science.",

            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, has found numerous applications in computer-aided diagnostics, monitoring and management of neurodegenerative movement disorders of parkinsonian type. These tasks are not trivial due to high inter-subject variability and similarity of clinical presentations of different neurodegenerative disorders in the early stages. This paper aims to give a comprehensive, high-level overview of applications of artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms in kinematic analysis of movement disorders, specifically Parkinson's disease (PD). We surveyed papers published between January 2007 and January 2019, within online databases, including PubMed and Science Direct, with a focus on the most recently published studies. The search encompassed papers dealing with the implementation of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis and assessment of PD using data describing motion of upper and lower extremities. This systematic review presents an overview of 48 relevant studies published in the abovementioned period, which investigate the use of artificial intelligence for diagnostics, therapy assessment and progress prediction in PD based on body kinematics. Different machine learning algorithms showed promising results, particularly for early PD diagnostics. The investigated publications demonstrated the potentials of collecting data from affordable and globally available devices. However, to fully exploit artificial intelligence technologies in the future, more widespread collaboration is advised among medical institutions, clinicians and researchers, to facilitate aligning of data collection protocols, sharing and merging of data sets.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The origin of colour categories and their relationship to colour perception have been the prime example for testing the influence of language on perception and thought (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis) and more generally for investigating the biological, ecological and cultural determination of human cognition (nature-nurture debate). These themes are central to a broad range of disciplines, including vision research, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, developmental science, cultural anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and philosophy. Unfortunately, though, it has been tacitly taken for granted that the conceptual assumptions and methodological practices from the dawn of empirical research on colour categorisation are the gold standard for current colour category research. Here, we show that these assumptions and practices are obsolete and flawed and have led to four fundamental and widespread misconceptions about colour categorisation: 1.) that colour perception is inherently categorical; 2.) that English Basic Colour Terms correspond to universal categories that are the end point of a fixed evolutionary sequence; 3.) that the prototypes of English basic colour terms are perceptually salient and qualify as focal colours; and 4.) that colour category research essentially revolves around the universalism-realism debate. State-of-the-art research on colour categorisation provides new, more sophisticated approaches and allows for rectifying those four statements. At the same time, some of the questions underlying those statements are not convincingly answered yet and constitute major challenges to future research. The critical considerations on colour categorisation may be transferred to research on other kinds of perceptual categorisation to inspire new, more general research questions.",

            "abstract": "In the Subset Feedback Vertex Set (Subset-FVS) problem the input is a graph G on n vertices, a subset T of vertices of G called the \"terminal\" vertices, and an integer k. The task is to determine whether there exists a subset of vertices of cardinality at most k which together intersect all cycles which pass through the terminals. Subset-FVS generalizes several well studied problems including Feedback Vertex Set and Multiway Cut. This problem is known to be NP-Complete, even in split graphs. Cygan et al. (SIAM J Discrete Math 27(1):290-309, 2013) proved that Subset-FVS is fixed parameter tractable in general graphs when parameterized by k. In split graphs a simple observation reduces the problem to an equivalent instance of the 3-Hitting Set problem with the same solution size. This directly implies, for Subset-FVS restricted to split graphs, (i) an FPT algorithm which solves the problem inO (2.076k) time (TheO () notation hides polynomial factors.) (Wahlstrom inAlgorithms, measures and upper bounds for satisfiability and related problems. Ph. D. Thesis, Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkopings universitet, 2007), and (ii) a kernel of sizeO(k3). We improve both these results for Subset-FVS on split graphs; we derive (i) a kernel of size O(k2) which is the best possible unless NP. coNP/ poly, and (ii) an algorithm which solves the problem in time O* (2k). Our algorithm, in fact, solves Subset-FVS on the more general class of chordal graphs, also in O* (2k) time. To the best of our knowledge, the fastest known exact algorithm for Subset- FVS on chordal graphs is based on the 3-Hitting Set algorithm of Fomin et al. (JACM66(2): 8, 2019) which runs inO* (1.5182n) time. Applying the results of Fomin et al. (2019) to our FPT algorithm yields two exact exponential-time algorithms for Subset-FVS on chordal graphs: a randomized algorithmwhich runs inO* (1.5n) time, and a deterministic algorithm which runs in O* ((1.5+ e) n) time for any fixed epsilon > O.",

            "abstract": "Hash tables are ubiquitous in computer science for efficient access to large datasets. However, there is always a need for approaches that offer compact memory utilisation without substantial degradation of lookup performance. Cuckoo hashing is an efficient technique of creating hash tables with high space utilisation and offer a guaranteed constant access time. We are given n locations and m items. Each item has to be placed in one of the locations chosen by k random hash functions. By allowing more than one choice for a single item, cuckoo hashing resembles multiple choice allocations schemes. In addition it supports dynamically changing the location of an item among its possible locations. We propose and analyse an insertion algorithm for cuckoo hashing that runs in linear time with high probability and in expectation. Previous work on total allocation time has analysed breadth first search, and it was shown to be linear only in expectation. Our algorithm finds an assignment (with probability 1) whenever it exists. In contrast, the other known insertion method, known as random walk insertion, may run indefinitely even for a solvable instance. We also present experimental results comparing the performance of our algorithm with the random walk method, also for the case when each location can hold more than one item. As a corollary we obtain a linear time algorithm (with high probability and in expectation) for finding perfect matchings in a special class of sparse random bipartite graphs. We support this by performing experiments on a real world large dataset for finding maximum matchings in general large bipartite graphs. We report an order of magnitude improvement in the running time as compared to the Hopkraft-Karp matching algorithm.",

Methods Judgements of plausibility and the ability to recognize argumentation fallacies were assessed with a novel computer-based diagnostic instrument (Argument Judgement Test; AJT). Results The items of the AJT partly conform to a 1-PL model and test scores were systematically related to epistemological beliefs and verbal intelligence. Item-by-item analyses of responses and response times showed that implausible arguments were more difficult to process and correct responses to these items required increased cognitive effort. Finally, the AJT scores predicted academic success at university even if verbal intelligence and grade point average were controlled for. Conclusion These findings suggest that the ability to evaluate arguments in scientific texts is an aspect of rationality, relies on reflective processes, and is relevant for academic success.",

            "abstract": "Many students use laptops to take notes in classes, but does using them impact later test performance? In a high-profile investigation comparing note-taking writing on paper versus typing on a laptop keyboard, Mueller and Oppenheimer (Psychological Science, 25, 1159-1168, 2014) concluded that taking notes by longhand is superior. We conducted a direct replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and extended their work by including groups who took notes using eWriters and who did not take notes. Some trends suggested longhand superiority; however, performance did not consistently differ between any groups (experiments 1 and 2), including a group who did not take notes (experiment 2). Group differences were further decreased after students studied their notes (experiment 2). A meta-analysis (combining direct replications) of test performance revealed small (nonsignificant) effects favoring longhand. Based on the present outcomes and other available evidence, concluding which method is superior for improving the functions of note-taking seems premature.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Objectives Medical three-dimensional (3D) printing, the fabrication of handheld models from medical images, has the potential to become an integral part of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (Oto-HNS) with broad impact across its subspecialties. We review the basic principles of this technology and provide a comprehensive summary of reported clinical applications in the field. Methods Standard bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Central Registry for Randomized Trials) were searched from their inception to May 2018 for the terms: \"3D printing,\" \"three-dimensional printing,\" \"rapid prototyping,\" \"additive manufacturing,\" \"computer-aided design,\" \"bioprinting,\" and \"biofabrication\" in various combinations with the terms: \"ptolaryngology,\" \"head and neck surgery,\" and \"otology.\" Additional articles were identified from the references of retrieved articles. Only studies describing clinical applications of 3D printing were included. Results Of 5,532 records identified through database searching, 87 articles were included for qualitative synthesis. Widespread implementation of 3D printing in Oto-HNS is still at its infancy. Nonetheless, it is increasingly being utilized across all subspecialties from preoperative planning to design and fabrication of patient-specific implants and surgical guides. An emerging application considered highly valuable is its use as a teaching tool for medical education and surgical training. Conclusions As technology and training standards evolve and as healthcare moves toward personalized medicine, 3D printing is emerging as a key technology in patient care in Oto-HNS. Treating physicians and surgeons who wish to stay abreast of these developments will benefit from a fundamental understanding of the principles and applications of this technology.

            "abstract": "The notion of stability is the foundation of several classic problems in economics and computer science that arise in a wide-variety of real-world situations, including Stable Marriage, Stable Roommate, Hospital Resident and Group Activity Selection. We study this notion in the context of barter exchange markets. The input of our problem of interest consists of a set of people offering goods/services, with each person subjectively assigning values to a subset of goods/services offered by other people. The goal is to find a stable transaction, a set of cycles that is stable in the following sense: there does not exist a cycle such that every person participating in that cycle prefers to his current \"status\". For example, consider a market where families are seeking vacation rentals and offering their own homes for the same. Each family wishes to acquire a vacation home in exchange of its own home without any monetary exchange. We study such a market by analyzing a stable transaction of houses involving cycles of fixed length. The underlying rationale is that an entire trade/exchange fails if any of the participating agents cancels the agreement; as a result, shorter (trading) cycles are desirable. We show that given a transaction, it can be verified whether or not it is stable in polynomial time, and that the problem of finding a stable transaction is NP-hard even if each person desires only a small number of other goods/services. Having established these results, we study the problem of finding a stable transaction in the framework of parameterized algorithms.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Place/transition Petri nets are a standard model for a class of distributed systems whose reachability spaces might be infinite. One of well-studied topics is verification of safety and liveness properties in this model; despite an extensive research effort, some basic problems remain open, which is exemplified by the complexity status of the reachability problem that is still not fully clarified. The liveness problems are known to be closely related to the reachability problem, and various structural properties of nets that are related to liveness have been studied. Somewhat surprisingly, the decidability status of the problem of determining whether a net is structurally live, i.e. whether there is an initial marking for which it is live, remained open for some time; e.g. Best and Esparza (Inf Process Lett 116(6):423-427, 2016. 10.1016/j.ipl.2016.01.011) emphasize this open question. Here we show that the structural liveness problem for Petri nets is ExpSpace-hard and decidable. In particular, given a net N and a semilinear set S, it is decidable whether there is an initial marking of N for which the reachability set is included in S; this is based on results by Leroux (28th annual ACM/IEEE symposium on logic in computer science, LICS 2013, New Orleans, LA, USA, June 25-28, 2013, IEEE Computer Society, pp 23-32, 2013. 10.1109/LICS.2013.7).",

To libraries, as organizations responsible for providing access to information, to knowledge and learning, it is essential the monitoring of social changes and technological transformations, so they can fulfill their role in contemporary society. In this context, with this study aims to identify the characteristics of the Brazilian scientific literature regarding social media and libraries in order to monitor its evolution and point out trends. This is a descriptive study of qualitative-quantitative nature, based on the domain analysis, proposed by Hjorland. The research universe consists of 54 articles published in national scientific journals of Information Science. It was found that the analyzed domain has been discussed in the community since 2007, especially in the context of University libraries. Most authors cited belong to Information Science, in collaboration with researchers from Social Communications and Sociology. The initial stage of formation of an epistemic community in Information Science was identified. Social networks has been the terminology commonly adopted by the researchers of the area to represent the communication environments mediated by the computer, though, the term social media has been featured in recent years. New lexicons in the analyzed domain have been identified for possible update of organization and representation schemes of knowledge produced in the country, in the field of Information Science.",

First, general statistical analysis based on the number of publications and citations was implemented to find the annual publishing trends, citation structures, most cited publications, and productive authors/institutions/countries/territories. Second, the co-citation networks of cited authors/sources/references were generated; the nodes, links, and total link strengths based on the visualized networks are used to analyze citation connections. Next, to detect the development of the research topics, the co-occurrence networks of keywords of the different stages were illustrated, and the burst detection of keywords is used to identify the emerging topics. Finally, the future challenges of the FODM journal are discussed according to the process and findings of our study. This study provides a systematic and objective view of the FODM journal, which can be helpful for scholars to understand the development and the research structure of this journal.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Approximate K-nearest neighbor search is a fundamental problem in computer science. The problem is especially important for high-dimensional and large-scale data. Recently, many techniques encoding high-dimensional data to compact codes have been proposed. The product quantization and its variations that encode the cluster index in each subspace have been shown to provide impressive accuracy. In this paper, we explore a simple question: is it best to use all the bit-budget for encoding a cluster index? We have found that as data points are located farther away from the cluster centers, the error of estimated distance becomes larger. To address this issue, we propose a novel compact code representation that encodes both the cluster index and quantized distance between a point and its cluster center in each subspace by distributing the bit-budget. We also propose two distance estimators tailored to our representation. We further extend our method to encode global residual distances in the original space. We have evaluated our proposed methods on benchmarks consisting of GIST, VLAD, and CNN features. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed methods significantly and consistently improve the search accuracy over other tested techniques. This result is achieved mainly because our methods accurately estimate distances.",

            "abstract": "By providing substantial amounts of data and standardized evaluation protocols, datasets in computer vision have helped fuel advances across all areas of visual recognition. But even in light of breakthrough results on recent benchmarks, it is still fair to ask if our recognition algorithms are doing as well as we think they are. The vision sciences at large make use of a very different evaluation regime known as Visual Psychophysics to study visual perception. Psychophysics is the quantitative examination of the relationships between controlled stimuli and the behavioral responses they elicit in experimental test subjects. Instead of using summary statistics to gauge performance, psychophysics directs us to construct item-response curves made up of individual stimulus responses to find perceptual thresholds, thus allowing one to identify the exact point at which a subject can no longer reliably recognize the stimulus class. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for visual recognition models that is underpinned by this methodology. Over millions of procedurally rendered 3D scenes and 2D images, we compare the performance of well-known convolutional neural networks. Our results bring into question recent claims of human-like performance, and provide a path forward for correcting newly surfaced algorithmic deficiencies.",

Medical images are habitually used in the segmentation process to extract the meaningful portions and to know and clarify the condition of the particular patient. In this article, we implement an efficient possibilistic fuzzy C-means (PFCM) approach to segment the lung portion in the computed tomography (CT) image and the result shows that it improves the segmentation accuracy upto 98.5012% and results are compared with existing segmenting approaches like fuzzy possibilistic C-means method, fuzzy bitplane method and so forth.

            "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is a way of making sense of the natural world and problem solving with computer science concepts and skills. Although CT and science integrations have been called for in the literature, empirical investigations of such integrations are lacking. Prior work in natural selection education indicates students struggle to explain natural selection in different contexts and natural selection misconceptions are common. In this mixed methods study, secondary honors biology students learn natural selection through CT by engaging in the design of unplugged algorithmic explanations. Students learned CT principles and practices and applied them to learn and explain the natural selection process. Algorithmic explanations were used to scaffold transfer of natural selection knowledge across contexts through investigation of three organisms and the creation of generalized natural selection algorithms. Students' pre- and post-unit algorithmic explanations of natural selection were analyzed to answer the following research questions: (a) How do students' conceptions of natural selection change over the course of a CT focused unit? (b) What is the relationship between CT and natural selection in students' algorithmic explanations? (c) What are students' perspectives of learning natural selection with CT? Results indicate students' conceptions of natural selection increased and natural selection misconceptions decreased over the course of the unit. Within their post-unit algorithmic explanations, students used specific CT principles in conjunction with natural selection concepts to explain natural selection, which helped them to learn the details of the natural selection process and correct their natural selection misconceptions. Students indicated the use of CT in unplugged algorithmic explanations in different contexts helped them learn natural selection. This study shows unplugged CT can be used to teach students science content, and it provides an example for further CT and science integrations. Implications for the field are discussed.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Common models for random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi and Kronecker graphs, correspond to generating random adjacency matrices where each entry is nonzero based on a large matrix of probabilities. Generating an instance of a random graph based on these models is easy, although inefficient, by flipping biased coins (i.e., sampling binomial random variables) for each possible edge. This process is inefficient because most large graph models correspond to sparse graphs where the vast majority of coin flips will result in no edges. We describe some not entirely well-known, but not entirely unknown, techniques that will enable us to sample a graph by finding only the coin flips that will produce edges. Our analogies for these procedures are ball-dropping, which is easier to implement, but may need extra work due to duplicate edges, and grass-hopping, which results in no duplicated work or extra edges. Grass-hopping does this using geometric random variables. In order to use this idea for complex probability matrices such as those in Kronecker graphs, we decompose the problem into three steps, each of which is an independently useful computational primitive: (i) enumerating nondecreasing sequences; (ii) unranking multiset permutations; and (iii) decoding and encoding z-curve and Morton codes and permutations. The third step is the result of a new connection between repeated Kronecker product operations and Morton codes. Throughout, we draw connections to ideas underlying applied math and computer science, including coupon collector problems. Audience. This paper is designed, primarily, for undergraduates who have some experience with mathematics classes at the level of introduction to probability, discrete math, calculus, and programming, as well as for educators teaching these classes.

            "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of flipped classroom on computer science students' engagement level among pre-university students. Computer science students were observed to be less engaged during the lecture of information system topic. Students fail to answer questions which need them to apply information system concepts into the real world situation. Hence, the flipped classroom approach is explored to solve the problem. With the increase in the usage of smart phones among students in higher learning institutions, cheaper prices of smart phones, mobile data plan and ready availability of instructional videos on the internet, the flipped classroom approach seems to be a perfect practice to be implemented. Therefore this research made use of the flipped classroom approach to gauge its efficacy on college students. Quasi experimental posttest only design was used in this research. Students were divided into two groups, namely a control group (didactic classroom) consisting of 41 students and an experimental group (flipped classroom) consisting of 43 students. These samples were chosen using purposive sampling. Students in the experimental group were required to watch a micro-lecture prior to coming to class and were involved in engaging activities in the classroom. After the intervention, both groups were measured in terms of their engagement level in class using a four-level Likert scale questionnaire which consisted of four engagement constructs namely behavioral, agentic, cognitive and emotional engagement constructs. Flipped classroom students' behavioral mean was 3.04, agentic mean was 3.06, cognitive mean was 3.16 and emotional mean 3.42. Findings showed that from the questionnaire, it was clear that the students in the experimental group (flipped classroom) were highly engaged. However, there was not much difference in terms of student engagement in the flipped classroom when compared to the didactic classroom.",

            "abstract": "Technological advancements allow the automation of every part of job interviews (information acquisition, information analysis, action selection, action implementation) resulting in highly automated interviews. Efficiency advantages exist, but it is unclear how people react to such interviews (and whether reactions depend on the stakes involved). Participants (N = 123) in a 2 (highly automated, videoconference) x 2 (high-stakes, low-stakes situation) experiment watched and assessed videos depicting a highly automated interview for high-stakes (selection) and low-stakes (training) situations or an equivalent videoconference interview. Automated high-stakes interviews led to ambiguity and less perceived controllability. Additionally, highly automated interviews diminished overall acceptance through lower social presence and fairness. To conclude, people seem to react negatively to highly automated interviews and acceptance seems to vary based on the stakes.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely referred approaches in medical data classification studies. LR, a statistical fitting model, is suggested in medical problems because of its well-established methodology and coefficients contributing to the evaluation of clinical interpretations. ANNs are graphical models structured with node networks interconnected with arcs each of which is expressed in terms of weights discovered throughout the modeling process. Since ANNs have a complex structure with its layers and nodes in the layers, which provides ANNs the ability to model any data with complex relationships. Among the various models having origins in statistics and computer science, LR and ANNs have prevailed in the area of mass medical data classification. In this study, we introduce the 2 aforementioned approaches in order to generate a model dichotomizing 75 opioid-dependent patients and 59 control subjects from each other. Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) absolute power value of each electrode were calculated for 4 consecutive frequency bands namely delta, theta, alpha, and beta with the frequencies, 0.5 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 20 Hz, respectively. Significant independent variables contributing to the classification were underlined in LR while a feature selection (FS) method, genetic algorithm, is being applied to the ANN model to reveal more informative features. The performances of the classifiers were finally compared considering overall classification accuracies, area under receiver operating characteristic curve scores, and Gini coefficient. Although ANN-based classifier outperformed compared with LR, both models performed satisfactorily for absolute power measure in beta frequency band. Our results underline the potential benefit of the introduced methodology is promising and is to be treated as a clinical interface in dichotomizing substance use disorders subjects and for other medical data analysis studies.",

            "abstract": "How does the discussion of human rights issues change over time? Without advocates adopting a human rights issue in the first place, international 'shaming' cannot occur. In this article, we examine how human rights discussions converge and diverge around new frames and new issues over time. Human rights norms do not evolve alone; their prevalence, framing, and focus are all dependent on how they relate to other norms in the advocacy community. Drawing on over 30,000 documents from dozens of human rights organizations from 1990 to 2011, we provide a temporal overview and visualization of the ebb and flow of human rights issues. Using our new dataset and state-of-the-art methods from computer science, our approach allows us to quantitatively examine (a) how new issues emerge in the advocacy network, (b) the relationship of these new issues to extant human rights advocacy and information, and (c) how the framing and specificity of these issues change over time. By focusing on the process by which a new issue gets incorporated into the work of advocates, we provide an empirical assessment of the first step in the causal process connecting shaming to improvement in human rights practices.",

            "abstract": "Currently, data are stored in an always-on condition, and can be globally accessed at any point, by any user. Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science.",

It provides an integrated overview of the current state of knowledge of emerging techniques using artificial intelligence integration in national screening programs around the world. Existing methodological approaches and research insights are evaluated. An understanding of existing gaps and future directions is created.Recent FindingsOver the past decades, artificial intelligence has emerged into the scientific consciousness with breakthroughs that are sparking increasing interest among computer science and medical communities. Specifically, machine learning and deep learning (a subtype of machine learning) applications of artificial intelligence are spreading into areas that previously were thought to be only the purview of humans, and a number of applications in ophthalmology field have been explored. Multiple studies all around the world have demonstrated that such systems can behave on par with clinical experts with robust diagnostic performance in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. However, only few tools have been evaluated in clinical prospective studies.SummaryGiven the rapid and impressive progress of artificial intelligence technologies, the implementation of deep learning systems into routinely practiced diabetic retinopathy screening could represent a cost-effective alternative to help reduce the incidence of preventable blindness around the world.",

            "abstract": "Choosing an academic field of study is an important economic decision; it impacts the skills acquired during the course of one's studies, the occupation and industry when entering the labor market, and consequently, one's potential salary. Using administrative records on the birth cohort of 1975-85 in Israel, we examine the impact of the choice of academic field of study on salary and find that this choice accounts for about 20 per cent of the explained variance in wages. In general, the effects we find are qualitatively similar to those found in a similar study conducted for the United States, although the variance found in Israeli data is slightly higher. Thus, compared with education studies graduates, we find a particularly high premium for computer science and engineering fields, and a negative premium for arts, psychology, architecture, and the humanities.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Gestures, widely accepted as a humans' natural mode of interaction with their surroundings, have been considered for use in human-computer based interfaces since the early 1980s. They have been explored and implemented, with a range of success and maturity levels, in a variety of fields, facilitated by a multitude of technologies. Underpinning gesture theory however focuses on gestures performed simultaneously with speech, and majority of gesture based interfaces are supported by other modes of interaction. This article reports the results of a systematic review undertaken to identify characteristics of touchless/in-air hand gestures used in interaction interfaces. 148 articles were reviewed reporting on gesture-based interaction interfaces, identified through searching engineering and science databases (Engineering Village, Pro Quest, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science). The goal of the review was to map the field of gesture-based interfaces, investigate the patterns in gesture use, and identify common combinations of gestures for different combinations of applications and technologies. From the review, the community seems disparate with little evidence of building upon prior work and a fundamental framework of gesture-based interaction is not evident. However, the findings can help inform future developments and provide valuable information about the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches. It was further found that the nature and appropriateness of gestures used was not a primary factor in gesture elicitation when designing gesture based systems, and that ease of technology implementation often took precedence.",

However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science-enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science-among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students' perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students' perceived autonomy related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.",

To date, abductive, inductive and deductive reasoning are considered as equally important for developing students' thinking skills, but only a few games have been designed for students to practice abductive reasoning. Thus, in this study, we designed a game named V-aquarium for junior high school students to practice abduction while learning science knowledge. To explore the effectiveness of the gameplay, using abductive reasoning, we attempted to understand the correlations between epistemic curiosity, cognitive fatigue, perceived learning value, and gameplay progress. A total of 307 valid data were collected for confirmatory analysis. The results revealed that two types of epistemic curiosity (interest-type and deprivation-type) were negatively related to cognitive fatigue but were positively related to the perceived learning value of gameplay (PLVG); cognitive fatigue was not significantly related to gameplay progress but was positively associated with the perceived learning value of gameplay. The implication of this study is that teachers could use V-aquarium to input the learning content they have taught for students to practice abduction in order to enhance their science knowledge learning.",

This allows the proposal of a logical framework-from a computer science perspective- for modeling such specific reasoning techniques towards an appropriate construction of legal arguments. Afterwards, we study the usage of assumptions towards construction of hypotheses. This is proposed in the dynamic context of legal procedures, where the referred argumentation framework evolves as part of the investigation instance prior to the trial. We propose belief revision operators to handle such dynamics, preserving a coherent behavior with regards to the legal interpretation used. Abduction is finally proposed to construct systematic hypothesization, with the objective to bring semi-automatic recommendations to push forward the investigation of a legal case.

Although 2011 saw the first learning analytics conference, the field draws from a long history of research in associated disciplines such as psychology, statistics, education and computer science. However, the novelty of learning analytics research stems from the access and analysis of large, yet granular, data sources that are generated from student interactions in online activities. The vast array and volume of accessible learning data have promulgated new approaches to understanding and measuring learning. As researchers pursue such algorithmically generated insights, there are parallel challenges to individual ethics and privacy and a broader consideration of the impact of an increased quantification of education. This special issue on the role of learning analytics in open, flexible, and distance learning (OFDL) environments aims to bring alternate perspectives to bear on how such analyses are improving learning while still addressing social and cultural challenges.",

The procedure combines cumulative logit regression with a cumulative extension to the ROC curve and performs as expected with ternary (three-level) ordinal outcomes under a variety of simulated conditions (unbalanced data, proportional and non-proportional odds, areas under the ROC curve [AUCs] from 0.70 to 0.95). Simulations also compared several criteria for selecting cutpoints to discriminate outcome levels: the Youden Index, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Total Accuracy, and Markedness. Total Accuracy demonstrated the least absolute percent-bias. Cutpoints computed from maximum likelihood regression parameters demonstrated bias that was often negligible. The procedure was also applied to publicly available data related to computer imaging and biomarker exposure science, yielding good to excellent AUCs, as well as cutpoints with sensitivities and specificities of commensurate quality. Implementation of cumulative ROC curve analysis and extension to more than three outcome levels are straightforward. The author's programs for ternary ordinal outcomes are publicly available.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Objective: Comorbid substance misuse and mental health difficulties are recognized as a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Amid cuts to health care services, computer-based interventions may provide support for patients experiencing these difficulties. The aims of this systematic review were to identify and investigate the efficacy of these computer-based interventions at improving substance misuse and mental health outcomes. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of CINAHL Plus, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Gray literature was also searched for relevant papers. Data were extracted from 33 papers, which met eligibility criteria by reporting a computer-based intervention designed to treat substance misuse and mental health in adults. Quality assessments were conducted on these papers. Results: Computer-based interventions generally led to an improvement of substance misuse and mental health outcomes within groups and when compared against waitlist control and psychoeducation. Computer-based interventions were effective at improving dual diagnosis outcomes, and improvements to mental health outcomes specifically were maintained for up to nine months. However, the combined effect of computer-based interventions and therapist support was found to be more effective than the effects of computer-based interventions alone. Conclusions: Many papers were limited by high attrition rates commonly attributed to \"digital\" interventions. Future research should consider systematically recruiting a range of participants, including those potentially affected by the digital divide, and incorporating methods within research to maintain engagement. This review was also limited by the heterogeneity of the papers reported, many of which differed between targeting dual diagnosis and targeting either substance misuse or mental health respectively, with outcomes investigating other difficulties out of curiosity.",

It is now transitioning from the hands of experts in computer sciences to biomedical researchers. Here, we introduce recent developments in DL applied to microscopy, in a manner accessible to non-experts. We give an overview of its concepts, capabilities and limitations, presenting applications in image segmentation, classification and restoration. We discuss how DL shows an outstanding potential to push the limits of microscopy, enhancing resolution, signal and information content in acquired data. Its pitfalls are discussed, along with the future directions expected in this field.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Dendronized polymers (DPs) are large and compact main-chain linear polymers with a cylindrical shape and cross-sectional diameters of up to similar to 15 nm. They are therefore considered molecular objects, and it was of interest whether given their experimentally accessible, well-defined dimensions, the density of individual DPs could be determined. We present measurements on individual, deposited DP chains, providing molecular dimensions from scanning and transmission electron microscopy and mass-per-length values from quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy. These results are compared with density values obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering on annealed bulk specimen and with classical envelope density measurements, obtained using hydrostatic weighing or a density gradient column. The samples investigated comprise a series of DPs with side groups of dendritic generations g = 1-8. The key findings are a very large spread of the density values over all samples and methods, and a consistent increase of densities with g over all methods. While this work highlights the advantages and limitations of the applied methods, it does not provide a conclusive answer to the question of which method(s) to use for the determination of densities of individual molecular objects. We are nevertheless confident that these first attempts to answer this challenging question will stimulate more research into this important aspect of polymer and soft matter science.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the leading cause of work disability and sickness absence worldwide. The prevalence of MSDs increases with age, consequently challenging sustainable employability among the growing ageing workforce. Knowledge of feasible and efficient workplace-based interventions to rehabilitate MSD or prevent its consequences is therefore warranted. This systematic review will evaluate the effectiveness of workplace-based interventions on MSDs and its consequences among adult workers with physical and sedentary work tasks, respectively. Methods We will search the following bibliographic databases: PubMed (including the database 'MEDLINE') and Web of Science Core Collection (including the databases 'Science Citation Index Expanded', 'Social Sciences Citation Index' and 'Arts & Humanities Citation Index'). Manual searches will also be performed. We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs reported in English in which (1) participants are adult workers with MSD, (2) interventions are aiming at rehabilitating pain symptoms of MSD or preventing the consequences of MSD and (3) interventions are initiated and/or carried out at the workplace. The review will adhere to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and the Institute for Work and Health (IWH) guidelines for workplace-based interventions. For the primary evaluation of the review, the quality assessment and evidence synthesis will conform to the IWH guidelines. Secondary evaluation will include a meta-analysis (unless the included studies do not allow this due to heterogeneity) and employ the risk of bias domains recommended by Cochrane along with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach on the studies with pain intensity as an outcome. Discussion This systematic review will provide knowledge on effective workplace-based interventions among physical and sedentary workers with MSD. RCTs are considered the most powerful experimental design in clinical trials, but solely including these may be too restrictive to understand effective workplace-based interventions where randomised and carefully controlled trials (RCTs) are not always possible. In order to maximize practical relevance, the selection process will, therefore, include both RCTs and non-RCTs and the quality assessment and evidence synthesis will conform to IWH guidelines focusing on developing practical guidelines for stakeholders. The result of this work will form the basis for industry-specific evidence-based recommendations on effective workplace-based interventions for rehabilitation of MSDs and its consequences that will later be operationalised into concrete and user-friendly practical tools for workplaces.

            "abstract": "The mammalian nervous system is comprised of a seemingly infinitely complex network of specialized synaptic connections that coordinate the flow of information through it. The field of connectomics seeks to map the structure that underlies brain function at resolutions that range from the ultrastructural, which examines the organization of individual synapses that impinge upon a neuron, to the macroscopic, which examines gross connectivity between large brain regions. At the mesoscopic level, distant and local connections between neuronal populations are identified, providing insights into circuit-level architecture. Although neural tract tracing techniques have been available to experimental neuroscientists for many decades, considerable methodological advances have been made in the last 20 years due to synergies between the fields of molecular biology, virology, microscopy, computer science and genetics. As a consequence, investigators now enjoy an unprecedented toolbox of reagents that can be directed against selected subpopulations of neurons to identify their efferent and afferent connectomes. Unfortunately, the intersectional nature of this progress presents newcomers to the field with a daunting array of technologies that have emerged from disciplines they may not be familiar with. This review outlines the current state of mesoscale connectomic approaches, from data collection to analysis, written for the novice to this field. A brief history of neuroanatomy is followed by an assessment of the techniques used by contemporary neuroscientists to resolve mesoscale organization, such as conventional and viral tracers, and methods of selecting for sub-populations of neurons. We consider some weaknesses and bottlenecks of the most widely used approaches for the analysis and dissemination of tracing data and explore the trajectories that rapidly developing neuroanatomy technologies are likely to take.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Introductory undergraduate courses present an opportunity to use disciplinary concepts in solving authentic problems. Making complex natural systems accessible to students through computer-based models allows them to practice making evidence-based predictions and communicate understanding. Despite the importance of modelling tools in formal classrooms, gaps exist in our understanding of how post-secondary students engage in computer-based modelling. Introductory courses, particularly in the hydrosciences, typically do not use these tools. This mixed methods study examines students' model-based reasoning about a water-related issue over two years in response to a flipped course model. Students in an introductory water course learned basic hydrologic content and used a computer-based water model to complete a project. Data came from a pre-/post-course assessment, student assignments, and student interviews. Results of quantitative and qualitative data analyses show that students in the revised version of the course (Year 2, n = 53) increased their understanding of core hydrology concepts and performed better on their evaluation of a computer-based water model, than students in the initial course (Year 1, n = 38). We tentatively attribute these observed changes to increased active learning opportunities surrounding computer-based modelling of water systems. Findings contribute to science literacy development, undergraduate science learning environment design, and undergraduate scientific modelling.",

            "abstract": "Measuring teachers' skills to carry out the complex tasks required in teaching is an important means of evaluating the effectiveness of teacher education but remains a challenging activity to conduct in practice. It is necessary to optimise approaches for usability and effectiveness along a continuum from low-effort and low-authenticity measures such as paper-and-pencil tests to high-effort, high-authenticity measures such as extended classroom observations. The first part of the paper reviews a range of efforts toward measuring the competencies of teachers and other professionals in carrying out the tasks that make up their work. These include performance tests such as computer-based simulations or simulations using actors, as well as the use of tasks requiring participation in or responses to video vignettes. Video vignette approaches typically have been less interactive than performance tests and interactivity is seen as a desirable feature. A novel framework for developing performance-oriented testing is then outlined. The second part of the paper exemplifies this framework in relation to providing explanations in physics classrooms. The development of a novel test instrument following the framework is described, and findings on construct validity are presented to support the applicability of the presented approach.",

Most life science systems contain hydrated macromolecules whose solubility, function and stability are modulated by several small organic molecules or salts (cosolutes) present simultaneously. This Perspective discusses solvation of mixed cosolutes in water. Recent computer simulations and experiments have shown that nonadditive cosolute effects on the water solubility of thermoresponsive polymers and on protein stability have a common physical origin, rooted in solvent excluded volume effects determined by mutually enhanced cosolute hydration in bulk. We discuss mixtures of weakly and strongly hydrated salts in the anionic Hofmeister series and mixtures of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide. Nonadditive phenomena in these mixtures lead to intriguing effects including consecutive polymer collapse and swelling transitions and counteraction of denaturant induced protein unfolding. The combination of today's advanced simulation methods and spectroscopy techniques should be used to improve further the understanding of these complex aqueous solubility problems.",

To address the problem, many enhanced sampling methods were introduced, which effectively extend the time scale being approached in simulations. In this perspective, we review a variety of enhanced sampling methods. We first discuss collective-variables-based methods including metadynamics and variationally enhanced sampling. Then, collective variable free methods such as parallel tempering and integrated tempering methods are presented. At last, we conclude with a brief introduction of some newly developed combinatory methods. We summarize in this perspective not only the theoretical background and numerical implementation of these methods but also the new challenges and prospects in the field of the enhanced sampling.",

Every facet of our lives is now touched by technology. As such, we're experiencing a digital transformation. Unfortunately, both as individuals and as a society, we're inadequately prepared to embrace the myriad of vulnerabilities presented by cybertechnologies. Unintended cyber vulnerabilities present significant risks to individuals, organizations, governments and economies. Here, we identify current cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in the life science enterprise and discuss the many ways in which these vulnerabilities present risk to laboratory workers in these facilities, the surrounding community and the environment. We also consider the cyberbiosecurity benefits associated with numerous innovations likely to be present in the laboratory of the future. The challenges associated with cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities are not insurmountable; they simply require thoughtful consideration by equipment designers, software and control systems developers, and by end users. Organizations and the individuals that comprise them must respect, value, and protect their data. End users must train themselves to look at every piece of laboratory equipment and every process from a cyberbiosecurity perspective. With this approach, cyberbiosecurity vulnerabilities can be minimized or eliminated to the benefit of workers, life science organizations, and national security.",

            "abstract": "Purpose Owing to the huge volume of documents available on the internet, text classification becomes a necessary task to handle these documents. To achieve optimal text classification results, feature selection, an important stage, is used to curtail the dimensionality of text documents by choosing suitable features. The main purpose of this research work is to classify the personal computer documents based on their content. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a new algorithm for feature selection based on artificial bee colony (ABCFS) to enhance the text classification accuracy. The proposed algorithm (ABCFS) is scrutinized with the real and benchmark data sets, which is contrary to the other existing feature selection approaches such as information gain and chi(2) statistic. To justify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) and improved SVM classifier are used in this paper. Findings The experiment was conducted on real and benchmark data sets. The real data set was collected in the form of documents that were stored in the personal computer, and the benchmark data set was collected from Reuters and 20 Newsgroups corpus. The results prove the performance of the proposed feature selection algorithm by enhancing the text document classification accuracy. Originality/value This paper proposes a new ABCFS algorithm for feature selection, evaluates the efficiency of the ABCFS algorithm and improves the support vector machine. In this paper, the ABCFS algorithm is used to select the features from text (unstructured) documents. Although, there is no text feature selection algorithm in the existing work, the ABCFS algorithm is used to select the data (structured) features. The proposed algorithm will classify the documents automatically based on their content.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated outsourceable activities through fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) techniques. The study, which involved five phases, relied on an integrated, exploratory research method. In phase 1, the qualitative method of meta-synthesis was used to identify the factors effecting outsourcing decisions. Next, the Delphi method was employed; in phase 3, questionnaires including paired comparisons of the items were submitted to 12 experts and the data gathered were analyzed through fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). The importance rate of every criterion was then decided. In phase 4, following an investigation into the available documents and identification of nine outsourceable activities at an Iranian university, the data for analysis were collected through the questionnaires submitted to 12 experts. The data were then prioritized through fuzzy SAW, fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy VIKOR. Finally, given the fact that the results of these methods were conflicting, aggregate techniques, namely rank average, Borda and Copeland, were used to reach a consensus. As the findings revealed, the Medical Sector and Installation Affairs Department of the Sciences College and of the Humanities College showed the top ranks, followed by the Computer Affairs Department of the Sciences College and of the Humanities College, and the Veterinary Clinic, respectively. The study proposed a model for ranking outsourceable activities, suggesting that decision-makers and researchers would have to consider numerous criteria and several methods simultaneously for selecting outsourceable activities.",

The research included ten participants who are blind, using three data collection tools: background questionnaire, pre- and posttest questionnaires, and learning curriculum with the sonified models. Results indicate that the sonified model facilitates access to key challenging scientific concepts, including complex phenomena. Findings indicate gains in learning science content; participants were able to collect and construct scientific knowledge through L2C interactions.

The framework is demonstrated in different applications, including quantifying uncertainties in computer simulations, multiphysics coupling, analysis of variance using machine learning surrogate models, deep learning of time series phenomena, and propagating parametric uncertainties of nuclear data. The applications demonstrated are oriented to nuclear engineering simulations, even though majority of the methods are applicable to other energy sources (eg, renewable).

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Polyadenylation signals (PAS) are found in most protein-coding and some non-coding genes in eukaryotes. Their accurate recognition improves understanding gene regulation mechanisms and recognition of the 3'-end of transcribed gene regions where premature or alternate transcription ends may lead to various diseases. Although different methods and tools for in-silico prediction of genomic signals have been proposed, the correct identification of PAS in genomic DNA remains challenging due to a vast number of non-relevant hexamers identical to PAS hexamers. In this study, we developed a novel method for PAS recognition. The method is implemented in a hybrid PAS recognition model (HybPAS), which is based on deep neural networks (DNNs) and logistic regression models (LRMs). One of such models is developed for each of the 12 most frequent human PAS hexamers. DNN models appeared the best for eight PAS types (including the two most frequent PAS hexamers), while LRM appeared best for the remaining four PAS types. The new models use different combinations of signal processing based, statistical, and sequence-based features as input. The results obtained on human genomic data show that HybPAS outperforms the well-tuned state-of-the-art Omni-PolyA models, reducing the classification error for different PAS hexamers by up to 57.35% for 10 out of 12 PAS types, with Omni-PolyA models being better for two PAS types. For the most frequent PAS types, 'AATAAA' and 'ATTAAA', HybPAS reduced the error rate by 35.14% and 34.48%, respectively. On average, HybPAS reduces the error by 30.29%. HybPAS is implemented partly in Python and in MATLAB available at https://github.com/EMANG-KAUST/PolyA_PredictionLRM_DNN.",

            "abstract": "By saving and storing information, we use digital devices as our external memory stores, being able to offload and temporarily forget saved contents. Storm and Stone [2015. Saving-enhanced memory: The benefits of saving on the learning and remembering of new information. Psychological Science, 26(2), 182-188] showed that such memory offloading can be beneficial for subsequent memory performance. Saving already encoded items enhanced recall of items encoded after saving. In the present study, we did not only replicate saving-enhanced memory but found saving-enhanced performance for unrelated cognitively demanding tasks. Participants solved more modular arithmetic problems when they were able to offload a previously studied word list, compared to trials without the possibility to offload. Thus, saving of recently encoded items entailed a general benefit on subsequent cognitive performance, beyond encoding and retrieving word lists. We assume that offloading frees participants from the need to maintain offloaded items. Gained resources can then be used for subsequent tasks with high cognitive demands. In a nutshell, memory offloading can help to reduce the amount of information that has to be processed at a given time, efficiently delegating our limited cognitive resources to the most relevant tasks at hand while currently irrelevant information are safely stored outside our own memory.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The development of the computer technology, as well as the research in the different science fields governing the core behavior of a Light Water Reactor, allows implementing all the known physics and consider detailed scales of analysis. Conversely to conservative approaches, the Best Estimate approach applies the available science by means of models and correlations that are applied in different scales using simulation tools. With this approach, the critical elements of the core can be evaluated with realistic predictions that can adjust the operation conditions and core design to more cost-efficient values without compromising the safety of the Nuclear Power Plant. The authors of this paper present the second part of a multi-scale and multi-physics methodology for the evaluation of fast transients in Light Water Reactors. In this part, the results obtained from the coupled Neutron Kinetics and Thermal-Hydraulics channel-by-channel core model are used for a detailed thermal-hydraulic pin-by-pin analysis and thermomechanics pin model. The aim of this work is to evaluate the safety analysis of the critical fuel rod in Turbine Trip scenario. For that purpose, the critical fuel rod is located using the minimum Critical Power Ratio. This safety variable is predicted in a thermal-hydraulic pin-by-pin model using CTF-UPVIS code. Afterwards, the conditions of the critical rod are loaded in a pin model for a simulation with FRAPCON/FRAPTRAN. Moreover, this paper proves the Best Estimate capability of the presented methodology by means of comparing the results with equivalent simulations that are more conservative, or consist of more limited simulation scales. On the one hand, the Best Estimate prediction is compared against the envelope of the minimum Critical Power Ratio along the axial nodal distribution of the simulated fuel rod. In addition, another comparison is made against assuming constant fuel-cladding gas conductance, showing the enhancement added by considering the axial distribution of this parameter, provided by FRAPCON/FRAPTRAN. On the other hand, the results of this methodology are compared against the limitation of accounting only the bundle radial average value of the minimum Critical Power Ratio. Furthermore, the Best Estimate results are complemented with an Uncertainty and Sensitivity analysis that will define the statistical boundaries of the prediction according to the 95/95 criterion.",

This paper argues that data science can have an equal if not greater impact in the area of earth and environmental sciences, offering a rich tapestry of new techniques to support both a deeper understanding of the natural environment in all its complexities, as well as the development of well-founded mitigation and adaptation strategies in the face of climate change.

The paper also describes a case study in environmental data science which offers up insights into the promise of the area.

Future collaboration between computer scientists and clinicians is critical to maximize the benefits of transformative technology in this field for patients. To illustrate, we describe AI-based advances in the diagnosis and management of gliomas, the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Methods: Presented is a succinct description of foundational concepts of AI approaches and their relevance to clinical medicine, geared toward clinicians without computer science backgrounds. We also review novel AI approaches in the diagnosis and management of glioma. Results: Novel AI approaches in gliomas have been developed to predict the grading and genomics from imaging, automate the diagnosis from histopathology, and provide insight into prognosis. Conclusion: Novel AI approaches offer acceptable performance in gliomas. Further investigation is necessary to improve the methodology and determine the full clinical utility of these novel approaches.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Using data to understand learning and improve education has great promise. However, the promise will not be achieved simply by AI and Machine Learning researchers developing innovative models that more accurately predict labeled data. As AI advances, modeling techniques and the models they produce are getting increasingly complex, often involving tens of thousands of parameters or more. Though strides towards interpretation of complex models are being made in core machine learning communities, it remains true in these cases of \"black box\" modeling that research teams may have little possibility to peer inside to try understand how, why, or even whether such models will work when applied beyond the data on which they were built. Rather than relying on AI expertise alone, we suggest that learning engineering teams bring interdisciplinary expertise to bear to develop explanatory learner models that provide interpretable and actionable insights in addition to accurate prediction. We describe examples that illustrate use of different kinds of data (eg, click stream and discourse data) in different course content (eg, math and writing) and toward different goals (eg, improving student models and generating actionable feedback). We recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Researchers in learning analytics and educational data mining have been successful in creating innovative models of data that optimize prediction. Some of these models produce scientific or practical insights and fewer have been put into use and demonstrated to enhance student learning. What this paper adds We provide examples of development of explanatory models of learners that not only accurately predict data but also provide scientific insights and yield practical outcomes. In particular, researchers with expertise in cognitive science and math education content use AI-based data analytics to discover previously unrecognized barriers to geometry student learning. They use model-derived insights to redesign an online tutoring system and \"close-the-loop\" by experimentally demonstrating that the new system produces better student learning than the original. Implications for practice and/or policy We define explanatory learning models and provide an articulation of a process for generating them that involves interdisciplinary teams employing human-computer interaction and learning engineering methods. Based on our experiences, we recommend learning engineering teams, shared infrastructure and funder incentives toward better explanatory learner model development that advances learning science, produces better pedagogical practices and demonstrably improves student learning.",

However, to date, only little research investigated the sources of belonging uncertainty. To address this research gap, we examined three potential sources of belonging uncertainty in a sample of undergraduate computer science students in Germany (N = 449) and focused on (a) perceived affective and academic exclusion by fellow students, (b) domain-specific academic self-efficacy beliefs, and (c) perception of one's individual performance potential compared to that of fellow students in the field. Perceived affective and academic exclusion by fellow students and domain-specific academic self-efficacy beliefs were significant predictors of female students' uncertainty about belonging in computer science. The perception of one's individual performance potential in comparison to that of fellow students, however, was a relevant predictor of both male and female students' belonging uncertainty in computer science. Our findings imply an expanded view of the theoretical concept of belonging uncertainty that goes beyond mere concerns of social connectedness.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the narratives of 93 Black women in computing in the USA to identify salient themes that are at the intersection of race and gender in the field of computer science. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a multi-method approach with a survey to describe the sample and a series of focus groups for in-depth analysis of themes. The qualitative methodology uses a grounded theory and consensual qualitative research approach with a research team that includes computer scientists and social scientists to collect and analyze data. Given the highly technical field of computer science and the intersectional experiences of the participants, this approach was optimal to capture and code data through the lens of Black women in computing. Findings The authors found four main themes that represented specific needs for Black women in the computing community. The first is the importance of linking Black women in computing (i.e. their recruitment, retention and career growth) to the bottom line of organizational and personal accountability. The second is effective cultural and educational supports for Black women in computing across pathways, starting in middle school. The third is to provide leadership development as a part of their educational and workplace experience. The fourth is a collection of empirical research and scholarship about and for Black women as a part of the computing literature. Originality/value Black women comprise one of the most underrepresented subgroups in the area of computer science in the USA. There is very little research about Black women in computing. To promote broadened participation in computing, there is a critical need to understand the narratives of successful Black women in the space.",

            "abstract": "Background Advanced physiotherapist-led services have been embedded in specialist orthopaedic and neurosurgical outpatient departments across Queensland, Australia, to ameliorate capacity constraints. Simulation modelling has been used to inform the optimal scale and professional mix of services required to match patient demand. The context and the value of simulation modelling in service planning remain unclear. We aimed to examine the adoption, context and costs of using simulation modelling recommendations to inform service planning. Methods Using an implementation science approach, we undertook a prospective, qualitative evaluation to assess the use of discrete event simulation modelling recommendations for service re-design and to explore stakeholder perspectives about the role of simulation modelling in service planning. Five orthopaedic and neurosurgical services in Queensland, Australia, were selected to maximise variation in implementation effectiveness. We used the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide the facilitation and analysis of the stakeholder focus group discussions. We conducted a prospective costing analysis in each service to estimate the costs associated with using simulation modelling to inform service planning. Results Four of the five services demonstrated adoption by inclusion of modelling recommendations into proposals for service re-design. Four CFIR constructs distinguished and two CFIR constructs did not distinguish between high versus mixed implementation effectiveness. We identified additional constructs that did not map onto CFIR. The mean cost of implementation was AU$34,553 per site (standard deviation = AU$737). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first time the context of implementing simulation modelling recommendations in a health care setting, using a validated framework, has been examined. Our findings may provide valuable insights to increase the uptake of healthcare modelling recommendations in service planning.",

            "abstract": "This article explores one group's use of action research (AR) and lesson study in three US university-level computer science courses affecting 85 undergraduate computer science and engineering students. It offers an overview of three areas including AR, lesson study, and engineering soft skills. The research group identified a problem: undergraduate engineering student soft skill understanding. The group collaborated to enhance participant engagement with this problem by utilizing one lesson focused on soft skills over three research lesson iterations in three distinct university semesters (2017-2018). Field notes were the main data collection method. Observational field notes were recorded in the three research lesson iterations, and themes from the notes were identified. The group valued peer interactions, and the research lesson adaptations as well as pedagogical changes were based on evidence. Four themes were identified, and participant comments were considered as the lessons became more focused . The research group argues that AR and lesson study are separate and distinct ventures based on this yearlong experience, which is counter to some other literature presented. Implications are large for all stakeholders interested in AR, lesson study, soft skill utilization, conflict management, and participant learning impact. Possibilities for enhanced participant engagement exists with honed lesson pedagogy.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Parallel computing has led to fundamental changes in almost all research areas associated with computer science; cryptography is no exception. Besides improved speed and resource utilization, parallel cryptography is also promising from the security point of view. In particular, cryptographic hash functions (CHFs) - \"the swiss knife\" of the cryptography toolkit - stand to gain a lot from parallelism. Consequently, there has been an increasing interest in research towards the development of parallel CHFs for faster, more secure and more efficient hashing, particularly since the competition for the SHA-3 standard. This paper attempts to consolidate the research efforts in the field of parallel hashing, exploring various approaches in this direction. Within each approach discussed in the article, CHFs have been classified on the basis of construction and their design, implementation and performance have been explained, with the primary focus on parallelism. Finally, a broad temporal overview of the developments in the field of parallel hashing has been presented.",

We assessed interest and confusion via event contingent experience-sampled questionnaires that displayed immediately after students had engaged with key examples or exercises. Results indicated that students' exposure to a UV intervention and gender affected the levels of confusion that students reported and the associations between interest and confusion levels over time.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Computer simulation can be used to predict human walking motions as a tool of basic science, device design, and for surgical planning. One the challenges of predicting human walking is accurately synthesizing both the movements and ground forces of the stance foot. Though the foot is commonly modeled as a viscoelastic element, rigid foot-ground contact models offer some advantages: fitting is reduced to a geometric problem, and the numerical stiffness of the equations of motion is similar in both swing and stance. In this work, we evaluate two rigid-foot ground contact models: the ellipse-foot (a single-segment foot), and the double-circle foot (a two-segment foot). To evaluate the foot models we use three different comparisons to experimental data: first we compare how accurately the kinematics of the ankle frame fit those of the model when it is forced to track the measured center-of-pressure (CoP) kinematics; second, we compare how each foot affects how accuracy of a sagittal plane gait model that tracks a subjects walking motion; and third, we assess how each model affects a walking motion prediction. For the prediction problem we consider a unique cost function that includes terms related to both muscular effort and foot-ground impacts. Although the ellipse-foot is superior to the double-circle foot in terms of fit and the accuracy of the tracking OCP solution, the predictive simulation reveals that the ellipse-foot is capable of producing large force transients due to its geometry: when the ankle quickly traverses its u-shaped trajectory, the body is accelerated the body upwards, and large ground forces result. In contrast, the two-segment double-circle foot produces ground forces that are of a similar magnitude to the experimental subject because the additional forefoot segment plastically contacts the ground, arresting its motion, similar to a human foot.",

            "abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop an instrument to measure employer branding in the information age. Firms increasingly migrate from matter-intensive business models to information-intensive models, where value lies in information rather than the physical objects. This shift has, in turn, led to a change in employee work skills. This is particularly true in the information technology (IT) sector, where firms rely on a limited supply of skilled labor. Employer branding, a firm's reputation as a place to work, is an important strategy to attract and retain employees. Design/methodology/approach From the literature, the authors developed and refined an instrument to measure key value propositions of employer brands. The potential IT employees surveyed in the study were students enrolled in the disciplines of computer science and information systems at a comprehensive university in North America. The study went through three stages resulting in an instrument for psychometric properties. Findings This research revealed eight employer branding value propositions that future IT employees care about. These dimensions are important for both IT firms and industries competing for skilled IT labor to understand and manage. Originality/value This paper extends the work of Berthon et al. (2005) on employer branding to the information intensive age and particularly the IT sector. It allows executives to manage and measure their employer brand so as to maximize competitive advantage in attracting and retaining skilled employees.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, Computer Science (CS) students must cope with continuous challenges related to programming skill acquisition. In some occasions, they have to deal with the internals of memory management (pointers, pointer arithmetic, and heap management) facing a vision of programming from the low abstraction level offered by C. Even using C++ and references, not all scenarios where objects or collections of objects need to be managed can be covered. Based on the difficulties identified when dealing with such low-level abstractions, the C-Sim application, aimed at learning these concepts in an easy way, has been developed. To support the tool, the C programming language was selected. It allows showing concepts, remaining as close as possible both to the hardware and the operating system. To validate C-Sim, pre and posttests were filled in by a group of 60 first-year CS students, who employed the tool to learn about memory management. Grades of students using C-Sim were also obtained and compared with those that did not use the tool the former academic year. As main outcomes, 82.26% of students indicated that they had improved programming and memory management knowledge, and 83.64% pointed out that the use of this type of tools improves the understanding and quality of the practice lessons. Furthermore, the marks of students have significantly increased. Finally, C-Sim was designed from the ground up as a learning aid and can be useful for lecturers, who can complement their lessons using interactive demonstrations. Students can also employ it to experiment and learn autonomously.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) has matured, it has opened a new frontier in theoretical and computational chemistry by offering the promise of simultaneous paradigm shifts in accuracy and efficiency. Nowhere is this advance more needed, but also more challenging to achieve, than in the discovery of open-shell transition metal complexes. Here, localized d or f electrons exhibit variable bonding that is challenging to capture even with the most computationally demanding methods. Thus, despite great promise, clear obstacles remain in constructing ML models that can supplement or even replace explicit electronic structure calculations. In this article, I outline the recent advances in building ML models in transition metal chemistry, including the ability to approach sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a range of properties with tailored representations, to discover and enumerate complexes in large chemical spaces, and to reveal opportunities for design through analysis of feature importance. I discuss unique considerations that have been essential to enabling ML in open-shell transition metal chemistry, including (a) the relationship of data set size/diversity, model complexity, and representation choice, (b) the importance of quantitative assessments of both theory and model domain of applicability, and (c) the need to enable autonomous generation of reliable, large data sets both for ML model training and in active learning or discovery contexts. Finally, I summarize the next steps toward making ML a mainstream tool in the accelerated discovery of transition metal complexes.

            "abstract": "The Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1, the atmospheric component of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model is described. The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km (similar to 0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to \"brute force\" tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models. Plain Language Summary This study provides an overview of a new computer model of the Earth's atmosphere that is used as one component of the Department of Energy's latest Earth system model. The model can be used to help understand past, present, and future changes in Earth's behavior as the system responds to changes in atmospheric composition (like pollution and greenhouse gases), land, and water use and to explore how the atmosphere interacts with other components of the Earth system (ocean, land, biology, etc.). Physical, chemical, and biogeochemical processes treated within the atmospheric model are described, and pointers to previous and recent work are listed to provide additional information. The model is compared to present-day observations and evaluated for some important tests that provide information about what could happen to clouds and the environment as changes occur. Strengths and weaknesses of the model are listed, as well as opportunities for future work.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "We report the proposal and results of a low-cost, easy-to-build GPS-based sensor for detection and monitoring ionospheric irregularities through the detection of amplitude scintillation. The system is based on the Raspberry Pi single-board computer combined with an Adafruit Ultimate GPS peripheral, which is capable of measuring (at 10-Hz rate) the intensity of the L1 signals transmitted by GPS satellites. We introduce and discuss results of short- and long-term observations obtained with a prototype of this system deployed in Presidente Prudente, a low magnetic latitude site in Brazil. The deployment and observations were carried out to test the ability of the system to detect ionospheric scintillations and, therefore, monitor the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities associated with equatorial spread F. Our results show that this low-cost sensor is indeed capable of detecting scintillation events associated with equatorial spread F. Comparison with simultaneous, collocated measurements made by a commercial scintillation monitor are also presented. The joint observations allowed us to quantify the performance of the low-cost monitor and to identify sources of potential limitations. While the sensor cannot (and it was not intended to) substitute commercial scintillation monitors, the low cost allows its use in studies of ionospheric irregularities (space weather) that require observations made by distributed arrays of small instruments (DASI). Furthermore, the simplicity of the sensor design stimulates its use in educational and citizen science initiatives.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background and objectives: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience challenges with social interactions, a core feature of the disorder. Social skills therapy has been shown to be helpful. Over the past several years, computer-assisted and robot-assisted therapies have been infiltrating the social skills teaching environment. Rapid progress in the field of technology, especially in the robotics area, offers tremendous possibilities for innovation and treatment or even education for individuals with ASD. This paper's purpose is to drive awareness of these innovative interventions in order to support the social lives of children with ASD. The aims of the paper are identifying (1) the types of Information Technology platforms that are being evaluated in computer and robot-assisted therapies for children with ASD; (2) the various disciplines or professions studying and utilizing these computer and robot-assisted social skill therapies; (3) the outcomes being evaluated in each trial; and (4) if results demonstrate benefits to children with autism. Materials and Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials published over the past five years. Search terms incorporated the subject intersection of autism, and computer or robot-assisted therapy. Results were mined for pediatric populations only and study designs establishing controlled comparisons. Results: Eighteen unique international studies were identified that utilize robot interventions (11 studies) and serious computer game interventions (seven studies). Most demonstrated promising results in improving outcomes for children with ASD. Study implications reveal a rapidly evolving assistive technology for ASD social skills therapy. Conclusions: These interventions show considerable promise, but more effectiveness and cost effectiveness research of high quality should be carried out with larger numbers of children. Also, further studies are necessary to evaluate these technologies' effectiveness amongst adults with ASD and within unique subsets of the higher functioning autism population.",

            "abstract": "This paper is published on the occasion of the 65th birthday of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ludger Lohaus, Director of the Institute of Building Materials Science, Leibniz University Hannover and coordinator of the SPP 2020, offering congratulations. Within the Priority Program SPP 2020 Cyclic deterioration of High-Performance Concrete in an experimental virtual lab, the damage mechanisms of high-performance concrete due to fatigue loading are investigated. At the Institute of Building Materials Science, Leibniz University Hannover, the influence of different concrete microstructures on the damage mechanisms is investigated in a conjoint project. Based on a systematic variation of concrete composition, for example, coarse grain aggregate, water/cement ratio and additives, different concrete mixtures, mainly high-strength concrete, with different microstructures are created and systematically analyzed. The results of the fatigue tests are analyzed regarding different damage indicators, for example, strain development, stiffness development, and acoustic emission. The overall objective is to obtain comprehensive knowledge concerning the damage mechanisms by conjoint analyses of damage indicators and results of the imaging techniques and to provide specifically aligned data to calibrate numerical models within the conjoint project. For future investigations, high-resolution imaging techniques, such as computer tomography and scanning electron microscope, will be applied to investigate the crack growth in the microstructure caused by fatigue loading. In this paper, the results of the analysis of the damage indicators for two high-strength concretes differing only in the type of coarse aggregate used are presented comparatively.",

            "abstract": "The role of materials in our daily lives vis-a-vis applications in areas like energy, environment, manufacturing and healthcare can hardly be undermined. Yet, transitioning a new material from its initial discovery to practical use frequently involves significant cost and time. However, of late, materials community is witnessing a fundamental change in the way novel materials are being designed. Recent advancements in computational capabilities coupled with improved quantum mechanical algorithms have paved path for accelerated design and screening of materials. This article briefly describes how we are leveraging modeling and simulation to design/screen materials for various applications such as transdermal drug delivery, high-strength alloys, lithium-ion batteries, corrosion inhibition, mineral processing and recovery of rare-earth elements. Each of the aforementioned examples make use of high-performance computing-based first-principle simulations (ranging from electronic scale to molecular scale) to arrive at a promising material, generating huge amount of 'data' in the process. The quantity of data accumulated as a result of these simulations is so large, that the word 'data' is no longer a cliche only for the computer science community. Moreover, at this point it seems imperative to substantiate how big data has just scraped research in the materials domain.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Traditionally, biologists have had to rely on destructive methods such as sectioning in order to investigate the internal structures of opaque organisms. Non-destructive microfocus X-ray computed tomography (microCT) imaging has become a powerful and emerging protocol in biology, due to technological advancements in sample staining methods and innovations in microCT hardware, processing computers, and data analysis software. However, this protocol is not commonly used, as it is in the medical and industrial fields. One of the reasons for this limited use is the lack of a simple and comprehensible manual that covers all of the necessary steps: sample collection, fixation, staining, mounting, scanning, and data analyses. Another reason is the vast diversity of metazoans, particularly marine invertebrates. Because of marine invertebrates' diverse sizes, morphologies, and physiologies, it is crucial to adjust experimental conditions and hardware configurations at each step, depending on the sample. Here, microCT imaging methods are explained in detail using three phylogenetically diverse marine invertebrates: Actinia equina (Anthozoa, Cnidaria), Harmothoe sp. (Polychaeta, Annelida), and Xenoturbella japonica (Xenoturbellida, Xenacoelomorpha). Suggestions on performing microCT imaging on various animals are also provided.",

In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing model in various areas of human life. However, cloud computing systems lack support for computer forensic investigations. The main goal of digital forensics is to prove the presence of a particular document in a given digital device. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various frameworks and solutions in all classes of digital forensics with a focus on cloud forensics.

            "abstract": "Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2, water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure. Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft, nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines to make a difference. Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized. Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion: Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging. For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte electrophysiology in various populations of patiets. We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing, imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for future precision medicine. Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body. However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients, immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts. Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based, constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods: Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated, in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower remaining soluble fractions (10% vs 40%) for visible light + Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants. This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and microstructure. Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by 50% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a staggering 9.6 % of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but merely fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to disrupt the paradigm of \"treating symptoms\" with \"restoring health\". Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up transforming therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune diseases, cancer and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced Therapies exist - it is reality, not fiction. Some products are already on the market, mostly for rare diseases which means only a few thousand patients worldwide have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At the advent of such a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks abound. To make the disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure chronic diseases a reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as standard-of-care for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to establish a sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating transdisciplinary research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join us for more details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory phase of the large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292). Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While basically everybody is forced to operate in a \"learning by doing\" mode regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided by notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and dedicated conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory requirements. Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic investor (a manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to receive trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it has to be stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR, especially the annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our technical approach and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance. We established a completely digital workflow for all our documents, including cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly based on open source tools. This allows us to handle the document management very swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality management system. The risk management is integrated as a cross-cutting-concern into all the product development processes. The main challenge in the planning and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and still is to estimate what has to be done, which norms do apply, and how much effort (time and money) it is to perform the steps and create all the required documents. A difficulty is that contradicting statements between the MDR and other applicable norms are still under interpretation and public discussion. Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations. Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for 3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35 mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system was 10 W. The power drop was within 10%. The results were verified by numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6, respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated, and recommendations for designing were given. Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68 mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2 exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design changes can be efficiently investigated. Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT) in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective, pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a 3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality (% of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions and HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (% of INR Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60% (poor), 60-70% (acceptable), 70-100% (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week groups were similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR target (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from any HRAE (38.9% vs. 25.0%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2% vs. 75.0%, p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7% vs. 91.7%, p=0.98) were comparable in both groups. The % of INR Tests in Range was significantly higher with the daily self-assessments (73.5% vs. 68.4%, p=0.006). Freedom from any neurological event (91.7% vs. 75.0%, p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly controlled INR POCT patients had a significant higher freedom from any neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2%, p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic strokes (100% vs. 76.9%, p=0.011). Discussion: Well controlled anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results in less neurological events including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT and subsequent dose adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a better quality of anticoagulation than 3x/week checks. Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes, reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20% of incident radiation to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm. Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20% can be expected. Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes. Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement. Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants. Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients) led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control. Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model. Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments. Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only, Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13, respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results: The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets. Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility longer than current ones. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included, which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47 patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014). C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95% CI = 4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95% CI = 0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95% CI = 1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of transplanted kidneys. Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis testing. This could lead towards a standardization of in-vitro thrombogenicity testing of RBPs. Objectives: Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is very important to provide such ready-to-use products for regenerative medicine and clinical application upon demand. Although cryopreservation of isolated cells seems to be well established, there are still a number of challenges associated with the cryopreservation of native and artificial tissues due to adherent cell state, limited heat and mass transfer as well as inadequate cryopreservation protocols. Here, we aim at developing an approach for efficient cryopreservation of electrospun TECs based on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Methods: Blend electrospun fibre mats (fibre diameter 0.8 +/- 0.2 mu m, thickness 100 +/- 10 mu m) were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 100:50) using electrospinning. The fibre mats (diameter 16 mm) were UV sterilised and seeded with MSCs (5x104 cells/cm2). The cells were cultivated on fibre mats for 7 days under static conditions and then frozen using 1 K/min cooling rate in a controlled rate freezer with different formulations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its combination with sucrose (with and without pre-culture with sucrose for 24 h). The viability of cells growing on fibre mats was monitored for 2 weeks after seeding and 24 h after thawing. Results: The results indicate that PCL-PLA fibre mats are biocompatible with MSCs (viability higher than 82%). Pre-culture with sucrose before freezing as well as its addition to DMSO-containing freezing medium significantly improved cell viability after thawing. Moreover, duration of equilibration of cell-seeded fibre mats with the CPAs before freezing affected cell viability post-thaw. Discussion: We showed that it is feasible to effectively cryopreserve electrospun TECs using controlled technological steps. This work could serve as a solid background for further development of efficient cryopreservation methods for biobanking of electrospun constructs for vascular or corneal tissue engineering. Objectives: There have been discussions on effects of pleural effusion on the breathing muscles dynamics. In particular, hemidiaphragm inversion influence on the pleural pressure (PPL) and ventilation parameters has not been precisely determined. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in PPL and ventilation parameters in patients undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis (TT). Particular attention has been paid to inversion of the hemidiaphragm caused by large one-sided pleural effusion. The analysis was based on virtual experiments performed on an artificial cardio-respiratory patient (AP). Methods: TT was simulated on AP, which consists of several cooperating models of the respiratory system mechanics, gas transport and exchange, and circulation. Three scenarios were considered: a) proper work of the diaphragm, b) flattening and fixation of the hemidiaphragm due to the large amount of fluid, c) paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm. Results: Simulations showed that during progressive pleural fluid withdrawal significant changes in the course of PPL were observed, particularly in scenarios b and c. Paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm significantly influenced the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) due to a kind of pendelluft: e.g., air flows out from the corresponding lung during inspiration and thus it flows to the lung in the hemithorax without pleural effusion. Discussion: Flattening and inversion of the hemidiaphragm have an influence on several physiological factors of which PPL and PAO2 seem to be the most important. Hence, TT may improve pulmonary system function particularly in patients with inverted hemidiaphragm. Objectives: Bone loss at implantation sites on oral cavities is a major problem for dental surgeons; in order to combat this issue, we developed 3 types of colagen biomaterial blends: chondrohitin sulfate, carbon nanotubes, and electric stimulated. Methods: Bovine colagen type I was dissoluted at 4% in formic acid 0,1M (Synth - Brazil) and divided in 4 groups: A- with Chondroitin Sulphate (Sigma Aldrich); B - carbon nanotubes suspention (Sigma Aldrich); C- eletric field ; D - control group. All of the samples were crosslinked with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) (Thermo Scientific-USA) and freeze dried at a LH2000 equipment (Terroni - Brazil). The samples were analized by: SEM; EDS; XPS; Bartha respirometry and FET. Results: All of the samples have the same macroscopic morphology. The SEM of the group submitted to electric field shows organization of the colagen fibers. The EDS shows atomic content of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen with other substances Discussion: The absence of contaminants within the samples and the increase in stiffness exhibit the compatibility of this material for use in bone augmentation in implantology. The material is shown to be not toxic, however more tests should be conducted prior to human use. Objectives: The optimization of the long term storage of cells and tissues is a challenging process with many variables but one factor is often overlooked: the freezing device itself. There are freezing containers that have to be placed in a -80 degrees C freezer and the manufacturer promises a cooling rate of 1 K/min. On the other hand there are controlled rate freezers where cooling rates from 0.1 K/min up to 50 K/min are promised. In this study we compared two commercially available freezing containers and four controlled rate freezers with respect to their functioning principle. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy of the adjusted cooling rate and the nucleation temperature of the samples. Methods: Seven 1.5 ml cryovials filled with 1 ml 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution were dispersed evenly over the rack of each freezing device. Constantan thermocouples (type T) connected to a RedLab device were placed in the middle of the solution of each cryovial to record temperatures every second with the respective software. The cooling rates were calculated from the melting point (-0.6 degrees C) of the solution to -30 degrees C with n=3. For all freezing devices a cooling rate of 1 K/min was set according to the manufacturers guidelines. Results: The freezing containers had sample cooling rates between 0.5 and 0.8 K/min. All controlled rate freezers showed cooling rates similar to the programmed cooling rate of 1 K/min. Higher cooling rates resulted in increasing deviations between programmed and measured cooling rates. The nucleation temperatures of the samples in the freezing containers were mainly between 0 degrees C and -6 degrees C. However, the controlled rate freezers showed nucleation temperatures mainly in the range of -6 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Discussion: Varying definitions from each manufacturer resulted in the observed cooling rate differences of the freezing containers. Limited heat transfer accounted for the increased cooling rate deviation recorded in higher programmed cooling rates. Objectives: Patients using ventricular assist devices (VADs) still suffer from adverse events such as pump malfunctions or thromboembolic events. This can be caused by thrombi that have formed inside the pump (pump thrombus). Therefore, there is a great need to prevent such adverse events through engineering measures in the early development stage of blood pumps. Currently, a numerical model to predict thrombus sites inside VADs is still missing and the risk can only be assessed with in vitro experiments in the late development stage. A recently found model for thrombus formation at high shear rates that was derived from simple stenosis experiments promises great potential in the application in computational simulations (CFD) of VADs. Methods: In this study, advanced high resolution URANS simulations of rotational blood pumps were conducted with the flow solver of StarCCM+ (Siemens) at an operating point of 5L/min at 75 mmHg. A k- omega SST turbulence model and the sliding mesh method was applied. The existing model for predicting high shear thrombus formation was applied and compared with observations from explanted pumps. Based on these results a modification of that model is proposed that suggests a wall normal transport due to the change of shear rate in flow direction. This modification was realized in the CFD by applying a correlation between the computed direction of the pressure gradient and the flow direction. Results: The application of the model shows that thrombus sites are overpredicted in rotational blood pumps when compared with experimental results or observations from explanted pumps. However, with a modification of the model which proposes that the influence is a wall normal transport due to a change in shear rate, a good agreement was found. Discussion: Since there is little data available in the literature that shows the position of pump thrombi the validity of these models remains unclear and has to be experimentally evaluated further. Objectives: Cryptogenic stroke is the cause of 40% of ischaemic acute cerebrovascular events. Study aim was to evaluate the recurrence of ischaemic cerebrovascular events in patients successfully treated by percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods: From February 2004 to January 2019, 314 symptomatic (243 stroke, 71 TIA) patients, (153 M 161 F; mean age 41 yrs, range 10-69) underwent percutaneous closure of PFO. 151 patients/314 (48%) had concomitant migraine, 90 (60%) with aura. 7 different occluder devices were implanted by transesophageal echocardiography, for a total of 317 implants. During follow-up all patients underwent clinical (Rankin modified scale) and quality of life (SF36) evaluations, transcranial Doppler (TCD), trans-thoracic echocardiography, and MRI. Cerebral and angio-MR assessed the degree of lesions by quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis performed before and after treatment. Sizes of lesions were measured by manual segmentation on the axial, coronal and sagittal images acquired. Results: Successful device deployment was achieved in 99% of pateints; patients were discharged home within 3 days. Follow-up was 100% complete (median 55.4, range 1-178 months). At 6 months, Rankin scale was 0 (p<0.0001) in 230 patients (95%) affected by stroke and 10 patients reached score 1. Quality of life improved significantly (P<0.0001). In 101/151 patients (67%) with migraine, intensity and frequency of attacks significantly decreased (P<0.0001). TCD showed residual microembolic signals in 10 patients, 3 patients required secondary successful treatment for an associate defect. TTE (after 1, 3, 6, 12 months and once a year for 5 years) showed optimal sealing of all devices without signs of erosion, incomplete closure and thrombus. In 265 patients cerebral MRI showed no new lesions at 2 years. Discussion: Our 15 year experience suggests that percutaneous treatment of PFO is safe and beneficial for secondary prevention of recurrence of acute cerebrovascular events irrespective of the device used. Objectives: Endovascular stent grafting is the standard treatment for patients with acute traumatic aortic rupture with extensive associated lesions. Very little long term information is available in large series. Methods: From March 1999 to September 2018, 83 patients (72 M and 11 F; mean age: 37.25 +/- 13.46;range 16 to 69) admitted with acute or chronic traumatic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. 60 cases had acute traumatic aortic rupture, due to road accidents in 69 patients and accidental falls in 3 patients. All procedures were carried out in the angiography suite. Left subclavian artery was always identified. Patients were followed-up in the out-patient clinic and by yearly angio CT-scan with regard to survival and complications. The follow-up was 100% complete. Results: Endovascular stent-graft treatment was successful in all cases of acute or chronic aortic injury. No post-operative paraplegia occurred. Control angiography showed optimal sealing and complete exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm from blood flow with no primary endoleak. Patients underwent treatment of all associated lesions later on during hospital stay. Two patients died in the hospital: 1 patient of cerebral haemorrhage and 1 patient of sepsis. During the follow-up 5 patients died (survival: 91.4%) for causes unrelated to the aortic procedure. no cases of perigraft leakage or aortic disruption were detected. During follow-up 1 patient had a steal syndrome and 1 patient paraplegia due to the covering of the left subclavian artery by endovascular graft. 4 years after treatment 1 patient had inner thrombosis of the graft developing a gradient; a new endovascular stent graft was deployed successfully. Freedom from complications was 92.3%. Discussion: The outcomes over 20 years of follow-up proves that endovascular stent graft repair is the first choice treatment in patients with traumatic aortic injuries. Our experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of endovascular treatment including patients with extensive associated injuries. Objectives: In vitro simulation of an in vivo environment for human stem cell research is crucial for any kind of biomedical purpose. While important factors like 3D-cultivation and physiological oxygen concentrations gain more attention in the scientific community, we still lack reliable methods to visualize the hypoxic response of cells in 2D and 3D in vitro systems. In this study we present human adipose-derived MSCs, modified with a genetically encoded hypoxia-sensor. Methods: We used a lentiviral system to stably integrate the genetic construct into the chromosomal DNA of mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the features of this novel biosensor we cultivated our cells in a 2D- and 3D-environment under various oxygen levels and evaluated the outset of biosensor-fluorescence via microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: The hypoxia sensor was successfully integrated in mesenchymal stem cells and could easily be induced by cultivating the cells in a hypoxic condition. MSCs, modified with hypoxia biosensors could be cultivated up to passage 20. Trilineage differentiation of MSCs (adipogenous, osteogenous and chondrogenouse differentiation) was also preserved by the cells after transfection. Using these cells we could monitor which 3D-cultivation conditions lead to hypoxic response of MSCs. Discussion: Our findings can help to improve our understanding of the influence of cultivation conditions on in situ oxygen concentrations. Moreover, by choosing the right 3D cultivation system, MSC can be cultivated in vitro under physiological hypoxic conditions. Objectives: Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a progressive disease with a low 5-year survival of <50%, which affects 23 million people worldwide. It is characterized by adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (dilated cardiomyopathy) due to an increase in filling pressures and myocardial wall stress. Pharmacological treatment and cardiac resynchronisation therapy have proven beneficial for survival. For patients with end-stage heart failure, a heart transplant or Left Ventricular Assist Device can be considered. A shortage of donors, patient selection and major downsides such as invasiveness and driveline infections limit the use of these treatments. Research has shown a 13% decrease in mortality for every 5% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, we developed a smart memory alloy configuration in order to increase the ejection fraction and obtain an increase of 3,5% in a bench model. To cope with ongoing left ventricular dilatation and rise in wall stress, this should be combined with adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint therapy. Our first aim is to measure local wall stress during a full cardiac cycle. Next, we aim to develop a mathematical model of the left ventricle to characterize the left ventricle in HFrEF patients. Methods: We will characterize in vivo wall stresses during the full cardiac cycle using Transesophageal Echocardiography and a left ventricular pressure catheter in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure. With these parameters, we will develop a simplified mathematical model of the left ventricle and we will improve our bench model for experimental testing. Results: This research will provide a characterization of the weakened left ventricular wall and the determination of optimal smart material properties and configuration of the cardiac assist device. Discussion: With this information, a patient-specific HFrEF treatment device will be developed combining active cardiac support and restraint therapy. Objectives: Clinical data on the hemocompatibility of membranes used in double filtration lipoprotein apheresis (LP) is virtually unavailable. The present trial compared the hemocompatibility of a recently introduced polyethersulfone (PES) based plasma fractionator membrane, FractioPES (R) 200, to an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) membrane during LP. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover trial, eight patients on routine LP were subjected to one treatment with PES plasma (0.6 m(2), 3M PlasCure (R) 0.6) and fractionation (1.9 m(2), 3M SelectiCure (R) H19) membranes and one control treatment using a set of EVAL membranes (0.5 m(2), Asahi Plasmaflo OP-05W; 2.0 m(2), Asahi Cascadeflo EC-50W). Intraindividual treatment conditions were kept identical. At defined times, samples were drawn at different sites of the extracorporeal blood and plasma circuit to measure white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PC) counts, complement factor C5a and thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII). Results: With a nadir at 25 min, WBC in EVAL decreased to 34 % of baseline vs. 64 % at 20 min in PES (P<0.001). PC only marginally decreased over time with both membrane types. Maximum C5a in venous blood was 30.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/L at 30 min with EVAL and 14.0 +/- 12.8 mu g/L at 25 min with PES (P<0.001). Compared to PES (23.3 +/- 15.2 at 5 min and 16.9 +/- 12.3 at 20 min, resp.), highest C5a concentrations were found in plasma after the EVAL plasma (56.1 +/- 22.0 mu g/L at 10 min; P<0.001) and fractionation filters (50.6 +/- 19.4 mu g/L at 30 min; P<0.001). ATIII levels did not rise until the end of the treatment without differences between membranes. Regarding Lp(a), LDL and HDL removal, both membrane sets performed equally (PES, 69.8 +/- 5.7, 64.9 +/- 8.8, and 17.4 +/- 13.6 %, resp., vs. EVAL, 69.5 +/- 6.0, 65.2 +/- 6.9, and 18.2 +/- 7.3 %, resp.). Discussion: Compared to EVAL, PES membranes are more beneficial with respect to the classical hemocompatibility of extracorporeal treatment procedures, namely leukocyte and complement system activation. Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become a standard therapy for adult end-stage heart failure patients. For pediatric patients, technological development lags behind with no currently approved implantable rotary blood pump. As an alternative, the HeartWare HVAD, originally designed for adults, is increasingly used in pediatric patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo the blood trauma potential of this pump in pediatric application. Methods: Blood trauma potential of the HVAD was investigated in-silico and in-vitro at an adult and pediatric operating point (5L/min and 2.5L/min at 2800rpm and 2200rpm, respectively). The flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics and analyzed regarding flow structures, shear stresses and washout. Hemolysis was assessed with pumps circulating bovine blood in a temperate flow circuit. Clinical outcome and indicators for in-vivo blood trauma were investigated retrospectively in 14 pediatric HVAD patients (age 11.3 +/- 4.8years). Results: In the pediatric conditions, simulations predicted elevated mechanical stress profile below 50mPa, more stagnant flow field, with longer washout times within the pump. In-vitro measurements revealed an increased normalized index of hemolysis (NIH = 17.5 mg/100L vs. 8.2 mg/100L, (p=0.0021)). In the retrospective in vivo analysis, LDH and D-Dimer values were 1.5 and 3-fold elevated, respectively, compared to adult HVAD patients. Major bleedings were observed in 42.9%, suspected pump thrombosis and neurologic dysfunction in 14.3% of all patients. Discussion: The HVAD, operated at lower speeds and flows, induces elevated blood trauma. These results highlight the need for specifically adapted ventricular assist devices, optimized for the pediatric population. Further studies are required to assess the clinical implications of these findings. Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, but it still has high rate of failure due to stenosis formation. Convincing evidence supports a key role of local hemodynamics in vascular remodeling, suggesting that disturbed flow conditions may be related to stenosis development. The purpose of our investigation was to explore the feasibility of coupling non-contrast enhanced MRI and high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (HR-CFD) to relate morphological vessel changes to local hemodynamics in AVF over time. Methods: We acquired non-contrast enhanced 3D fast spin echo MRI (CUBE T1) at 1 and 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radio-cephalic AVF creation in one patient. We generated 3D models and evaluated lumen cross-sectional area changes over time. We perfomed CFD simulations using pimpleFoam solver of OpenFoam, prescribing blood flow waveforms derived by Ultrasound examination. We computed the 2 components of the wall shear stress vector over time, namely WSSdir, the component in the mean direction of the WSS vector and WSStr, the transversal component. Results: We observed a dilatation of the vein until 6 months, with a more pronounced increase in the venous outflow as compared to the juxta-anastomotic vein (JAV). The increase in vein's diameter was then followed by a narrowing of JAV at 1 year after AVF surgery. We found high-frequency fluctuations both for WSSdir and WSStr components, in different locations of the vein, at 6 weeks and 6 months after AVF creation. Oscillations of both components damped at 1 year after AVF creation, as a result of vessel remodeling. Discussion: Optimized CUBE T1, coupled with HR-CFD, allowed a characterization of morphological and hemodynamic changes over time. Our MRI-to-CFD pipeline represents a promising approach to elucidate mechanisms of local vascular remodeling and can be used for clinical investigations aimed at identifying critical hemodynamic factors responsible for AVF failure. Objectives: For 30 years, the mortality rate of patients hospitalized in intensive care unit has been drastically reduced. But an increase in muscle dysfunctions at the end of intensive care stay, leading to long term functional disability was observed at the same time. The physiological mechanism remains poorly understood due to a lack of study tools. The objective of this work is therefore to create a new tool for the tissue construction of an in vitro skeletal muscle. This tool should allow a muscle construction which mimics physiological reality, in order to model the disease more accurately. Also, it should allow mechanical and electrical stimulation in order to simulate the resumption of muscle contraction of patients. Methods: Using sol-gel process, we synthesized a new biomaterial, based on an epoxy organic-inorganic hybrid precursor (g-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). This biomaterial was deposited as a thin layer (spin-coating process) of 7 mu m thickness on a silicone membrane suitable to undergo mechanical stretching. The biomaterial was microstructured using the UV laser writing lithography to create a line network. This line network was revealed with a 2-minute isopropanol bath and we obtained lines of 8 mu m thickness spaced of 175 mu m. To ensure a biological environment and a strong adhesion of cells on microstructured silicone support during mechanical stretching, we grafted silylated bioactive peptides using dip-coating process. Results: Muscular stem cells which were isolated from patients' quadriceps biopsy were seemed and, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed a growth of muscle fibers along the lines, mimicking the physiological organization of a muscle. Discussion: We were able to model the first stages of a complex muscle organoid in vitro using a new tool manufactured by a fast, simple and reproducible process. With the mechanical and electrical stimulation of this muscle-on-a-chip, this work should allow us to better understand these muscle dysfunctions and find new treatments. Objectives: Cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is a promising strategy which may facilitate their future clinical application. This is very challenging and ambitious task and therefore recent efforts have been focused on developing new cryopreservation strategies for long-term storage of TECs. This work covers some practical considerations for cryopreservation of cell-free and cell-seeded scaffolds vastly differing by structure and composition. Methods: The first test system includes 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds prepared by freeze-drying and coaxial alginate macrospheres prepared by electrospraying. Samples were frozen at 1 K/min either in a bulk DMSO solution (with and without sucrose) or after removal of residual solution. After thawing, we evaluated compression (collagen-HAP scaffolds) and rheological properties (coaxial alginate macrospheres) of cell-free systems. Viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within both types of scaffolds was evaluated 24-h post-thaw using live-dead assay. The second test system comprises flat fiber mats (produced from polycaprolactone/polylactic acid using electrospinning) seeded with CHO cells. This system intends to develop plate electrodes for electroporation of attached cells with non-permeable cryoprotective agents (CPAs) such as sugars for future cryopreservation applications. Results: All scaffolds were cytocompatible with corresponding cell types. Freezing after removal of residual solution was superior to conventional freezing. Addition of sucrose increased cell viability (both scaffold types) and improved viscoelastic properties of coaxial macrospheres. Constructed plate electrodes provided good compromise between high cell permeabilisation and viability after electroporation with sucrose at 1.7 kV/cm electric field. Discussion: The findings suggest that it is feasible to cryopreserve cell-free and cell-seeded scaffolds using DMSO and sucrose. As a step further, there are high expectations associated with using electroporation as a mean for intracellular delivery of non-toxic CPAs towards DMSO-free cryopreservation of TECs. Objectives: Tailored Forming is a new manufacturing technology to manufacture solid components out of two or more different metals. The components are joined to a hybrid semi-finished workpiece. Afterwards, a forming process is performed to improve the materials properties. This allows creating hybrid metallic parts that are adjusted to their specific loads and their field of application in comparison to parts made out of monomaterials. The potential use case of Tailored Forming-parts is still being researched. Biomedical implants are a potential field of application. In the presented study, the contact mechanics of two potential concepts for Tailored Forming hip implants were analysed. Methods: Both concepts consist of a magnesium component that should be resorbed in the human body and leads to a better bone growth. A second component in the implants is used to absorb loads. In a numerical analysis the two implants were compared to a conventional implant. For the potential evaluation two load cases \"walking\" and \"walking upstairs\" were considered. Results: While one concept leads to higher stresses in the implant, the other concept shows almost similar stress distributions as the conventional implant and has the additional advantage of the better bone growth due to the magnesium component. Discussion: Based on this work further research on different implant concepts has to be made to give a clear statement about the potential of Tailored Forming-Implants. Objectives: In consideration of the recently published implant files, testing of medical devices has gained signifigant importance. Many medical implants are subject to normative testing during their regulatory approval process, such as stents, heart valves and blood pumps. No testing norm or standard, however, exists for regulatory approval of left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Therefore, this study aimed to establish in-vitro bench tests for LAA occlusion (LAAo) devices and compares the clinically most widely used devices. Methods: Seven different LAA occlusion systems with device diameter ranging between 22 and 34 mm were tested regarding tug force and radial force resulting in a total of 24 devices. Radial force was assessed in a commercially available tester whereas tug force was evaluated in a novel in-vitro test setup consisting of bovine tissue. Results: Significant differences in the mechanical properties of the different devices were observed. Radial force ranged between 8.6 N at maximum compression for the LAmbre 2228 device and 0.1 N for the Occlutech 27 mm implant at minimum compression. A similar variability of mechanical properties was seen in the tug test results. Values ranged from 4.6 N to 0.4 N for the Wavecrest 22 mm and the Occlutech 24 mm device, respectively, at maximum and minimum compression. Discussion: Large variations in mechanical properties were seen between the different devices. The study showed that device stability is more dependent on anchoring structures, such as hooks and barbs, than on radial force. A strong positive correlation between the number of anchoring structures per millimeter circumference of an occluder and its tug force was found (r=0.87, p < 0.01). The large variations in mechanical properties aggravate comparison of current LAA occlusion devices which underlines the need for standardized preclinical testing to prompt clinical compatibility. Objectives: Pump thrombosis is a severe adverse event in ventricular assist devices. Current therapy often involves an exchange of the entire pump. Alternative solutions must be explored to reduce surgery numbers. A protocol for in vitro lysis of LVAD specific thrombus with alteplase was established in this study. Methods: A fluid chamber of silicone tubing was filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution. An artificial human thrombus was suspended within. Alteplase was added to the system according to the maximum dose for clinical use, 0.028 mg/ml. Five experiments each were conducted for stasis and fibrin thrombi respectively. Both types were lysis tested for four and 24 hours each. Fluid samples and photographs were taken for dissolution evaluation. Results: Visual inspection of the fibrin thrombus showed clear dissolution. For the stasis thrombus, the 24 h experiment produced no discernible dissolution of the thrombi, while the thrombi investigated over the 4 h period fragmented into small pieces which did not dissolve entirely. D-dimer levels in the fibrin thrombus tests rose steadily through the alteplase treatment for both test durations (short test 12800-25600 ng/ml, long test 25600-51200 ng/ml). For the short term stasis thrombus testing, D-dimer values rose similarly to the fibrin thrombus, but levels remained much lower (short test 1600-3200 ng/ml, long test >200 ng/ml). Long term stasis thrombus tests showed no significant rise in D-dimer levels. Discussion: Alteplase was successful in dissolving fibrin thrombi in our experimental setup. D-dimer analysis supported the visual impression. The fragmentation of stasis thrombi and D-dimer levels measured may be due to the drug's fibrinolytic effect. The amount of erythrocytes in a stasis thrombus may resist lysis and produce challenges in the clinical application of thrombus lysis treatment. With this setup we were able to examine the reaction of the LVAD thrombi to Alteplase. This information can be used to further optimise clinical lysis therapy. Objectives: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy was used in the initial phase of induction therapy in some patients. This study was conducted in order to examine the short and long term effect of methylprednisolone pulse therapy for the lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy. Methods: The retrospective study included 43 patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis receiving muti-target therapy in our center, including prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. 19 patients received methylprednisolon pulse therapy in the initial phase of induction therapy, 24 patients only received prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. The dose of methylprednisolonpulse therapy was intravenous injection 500mgx3 days and the following prednisone dose was 0.8-1.0mg/kg. We compared the primary and secondary outcomes of the two groups. In the patients combined with acute renal injury (AKI) subgroup, we also compared the primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups. Results: In the primary outcome, the CR rates are similar between the two groups. We did not find significant difference in the total remission rate (either complete or partial) between the two groups (p=0.93). The same is true for the remission time (p=0.87). There was no significant difference in the time and number of patients entering hemodialysis between the two groups (p=0.65). Although, in the AKI subgroup, there was a significant difference in the serum creatinine between the two groups in 1 month (P=0.045). However, there was no significant difference in the following up, and the probability of achieving CR and replase (calculated by using the Kaplan - Meier method) also had no significant difference. Discussion: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy seemed to have no significant effect on the long-term prognosis of lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy and it could not delay the patients' entry into hemodialysis. However, it may have had a better effect on the recovery of AKI patients and rapid relief of inflammatory reactions. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate intradialytic on-line multicomponent total removed solutes (TRS) monitoring in the spent dialysate, as potentially more objective parameter for removal of uremic solute markers urea, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and beta 2-Microglobulin (B2M) compared to relative indices as removal ratio, using a novel miniaturized optical sensor during hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings. Methods: Ten ESKD patients (6 M and 4 F, 60.2 +/- 16.8 yrs) on chronic HDF were followed during 5 midweek dialysis sessions each (length 240min, HD: N=1, Qb=200ml/min, Qd=300ml/min, FX60; HDF: N=4, Qb > 300ml/min, Qd > 500ml/min, Vsubst > 15l, FX800 and FX1000). Spent dialysate from the drain was monitored on-line by a miniaturized sensor prototype (Optofluid Technologies Ou, Estonia). For total dialysate collection method as the reference, a spent dialysate sample from the tank at the end of each dialysis session was taken. The concentrations of urea and B2M were determined in the clinical laboratory. Concentration of IS was determined utilizing the HPLC. Based on differences between laboratory and optical sensor TRS values BIAS and standard error (SE) were calculated. A t-test was used to determine significant differences (P <= 0.05). Results: The average TRS values of optical sensor and laboratory were 510 +/- 86mM/L and 485 +/- 106mM/L for urea, 224 +/- 41mg/L and 228 +/- 47mg/L for B2M, and 732 +/- 371 mu M/L and 719 +/- 392 mu M/L for IS, respectively. No statistical differences were found between optical and laboratory TRS values for any uremic solute. The relative BIAS +/- SE values of the TRS were -7.99 +/- 19.43% for urea, 0.07 +/- 15.60% for B2M, and -4.72 +/- 13.25% for IS, respectively. Discussion: Novel miniaturized optical sensor successfully carried out intradialytic on-line multicomponent TRS monitoring in the spent dialysate. Objectives: Perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) and management is of paramount importance during perioperative treatment of patients with multiorgan failure. Recent results have shown that such interoperative TGC led to an improvement of morbidity and mortality and to a prevention of Surgical site infection (SSI) in ICU patients. Consequently, a user-friendly device combining glucose analysis and delivery of glucose and insulin should allow for better therapies. Methods: Based on an already existing artificial pancreas device (STG-22), a new artificial endocrine pancreas system (STG-55) was developed. With a battery incorporated, it uses again a closed loop analytical system. Due to its in-built sensors, the closed-loop system allows for a quick and easy feed-back analysis of patient data through already established algorithms for glucose and insulin infusion. With the help of a disposable modular tubing circuit blood sampling from the patient's vein is realized and assessed by an automatically calibrated sensor. The device exhibits a maneuverable weight of only 36 kg and can be set-up within a single hour. Results: Clinical trials with STG-55, in Japan (Kochi University Hospital) have proven its re not sign liable practicability. Glucose monitoring was stable and results comparable to the analyses of an independent glucose analyzer with a high correlation coefficient. Due to appropriate insulin administration, no hypoglycemia was observed in patients under investigation. Discussion: The advent of new technological tools, such as miniaturized analytical devices in combination with the application of patient-specific precise algorithms allows for a strict and successful therapy without hypoglycemia in perioperative patients. With the new design and concept of STG-55, the set-up time for the artificial pancreas can be reduced down to 30% of preexisting devices, which finally makes a glucose and insulin management in both the interoperative and the ICU user friendly. The generation of complex cellular structures for human application often requires a matrix, defining the three-dimensional shape and mechanical properties of the artificial tissue. The matrix as such is not viable. If this matrix is of human origin, Directive 2004/23/EC (in its national version) shall apply. In that case only \"non-substantial\" processing methods may be utilized, which are specified in Regulation 1294/2007/EC. For example, non-cellular substances can be extracted from the tissue, so-called derivatives. These derivatives, if of human origin, are also tissues within the meaning of Directive 2004/23/EC. If these derivatives are further processed, or if the tissue originates from animals, the matrix is classified as a medical device. The Human Tissue Authority describes the delimitation as follows: \"Derivatives of non-viable tissues and cells such collagen fillers (i.e. collagen extracted from tissues and cells) fall under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Non-viable tissue and cell products such as demineralized bone matrix, or acellular human tissues or tissue matrices, will not be covered by the MDR. They will continue to fall under the Directive 2004/23/EC.\" The paper deals in more detail with the problem of demarcation and describes the consequences of this in practice. We will discuss the problem of demarcation in more detail as well as describe the consequences in practical implementation. Objectives: In this study, two attempts of new biomaterial development based on the latest results of cell biology and tissue engineering are reported. One is specific cell separation using DNA as linker, and another is novel hybrid materials constructed by decellularized tissues complexed with synthetic polymer. Methods: Antibody was immobilized via desthiobiotin-avidin interaction. Single strand DNA (20mer) was chemically immobilized on the surface and then antibody (anti-mouse CD45, mCD45) modified with the complementary single strand DNA was immobilized on the surface through DNA duplex formation. Decellularized porcine dermis was prepared and lyophilized. After that, methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer were immersed in stages, then polymerization was proceeded. The obtained hybrid material was analyzed by tensile strength and SEM observation. Results: Cells were also adhered on the surface at 37 degrees C and detached by 4 degrees C incubation with remaining cells that interacted with the surface via antibody-antigen interaction. The adhered cells were released by DNase treatment. These results suggest that cells can be selectively captured and collected by using the surface that immobilizes an antibody via dissociation molecules. The monomer absorption depends strongly on the tissue structure. Gradient-type decellularized dermis-poly(methyl methacrylate) complex was prepared by controlling the permeation time of the methyl methacrylate monomer. The mechanical strength of this complex gradually increased from the dermis side to the polymer side. Discussion: Developing new biomaterials combining new knowledge among different science discipline is an indispensable methodology for the next generation of medical development. The materials presented here are example of these biomaterials, and show the direction of future biomaterial development. Objectives: This investigation discusses the method of electrical stimulation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and skin fibroblasts (FB) growing on substrates composed by carbon nanotubes and organic compounds. Methods: Substrates were produced from a water dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes and organic compounds (serum albumin, collagen, chitosan) and formed by evaporation of the liquid component using infrared laser radiation. Laser exposure stimulated the formation of conductive nanotube clusters responsible for electrical signal transmission to the cells, and organic compounds improved cell adhesion due to the presence of cell membrane receptors sensitive to matrix proteins and aminosugar molecules. An aseptic system for electrical cell stimulation included an electric pulse generator, culture plate with cells with a breadboard and electrodes made of surgical steel with gold plating. Cells were stimulated for 48 hours with pulsed electric signal (60-200 mV amplitude, 1 ms pulse duration, 1 s pause) directly inside the CO2-incubator. Results: The effects of electrical stimulation on the cell proliferation were estimated by MTT-test. It was found that both MSC and FB are sensitive to the stimulus, but the most prominent increase of cell proliferation was detected at 80 mV pulse amplitude. In these conditions, a 13 and 16 percent augmentation of cell growth rate was obtained for MSC and FB, respectively. Similar results (the formation of denser cell monolayer) were achieved by fluorescent microscopy of cell nuclei stained by ethidium bromide and fluorescein diacetate. No pathological changes in cell morphology were observed. Discussion: The obtained results suggest that MSC and FB growing on conductive substrates are sensitive to electrical stimulation. This observation can be explained by the activation of potential-controlled ion channels and the stimulation of metabolic processes that accelerate cell growth. Objectives: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System (ModELAS) is a highly compact, modular, fully integrated pump-lung. The device can be configured to provide adult low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) (removal of 30-50% of metabolic CO2), full adult respiratory support or full pediatric respiratory support. The modular design allows for the exchange of the 0.65 m(2) adult bundle and the 0.3 m(2) pediatric bundle, while all other device components are identical. These studies characterized the in vivo performance of the ModELAS for each application. Methods: In vivo device performance was evaluated in healthy sheep (n=4 7-day ECCO2R, n=6 30-day adult ECMO, n=3 7-day pediatric ECMO). Pediatric studies utilized a right atrium to pulmonary artery cannulation strategy while adult studies utilized a dual lumen cannula placed in the jugular vein. Animals were recovered and tethered within a pen. The target blood flow rate was 0.5 L/min for ECCO2R and 2-3 L/min for the ECMO applications. Anticoagulation was achieved via continuous heparin infusion. Animal hemodynamics were measured hourly, and blood chemistry, gas transfer and plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb) were measured throughout each study. Results: All animals were recovered and 9 animals completed the full study duration. Average CO2 removal during ECCO2R was 74 +/- 6 mL/min. Average adult and pediatric oxygenation was 134 +/- 10 mL/min and 94 +/- 11 mL/min, respectively. Average PfHb was less than 25 mg/dL, with the exception of one study following an acute kidney injury. Early terminations were due to a pulmonary embolism, a hemothorax, an intra-bundle thrombus and a fractured cannula. Typical explanted devices exhibited minimal thrombus. When present, thrombi were primarily located at the bundle inlet surface and impeller pivot. Discussion: These studies are on-going, but demonstrate positive performance of the ModELAS across a clinically relevant respiratory support spectrum. Objectives: Various modes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with or without a pump have been used as a bridge to lung transplantation in clinical settings. We have started to develop a large animal model for testing newly developed artificial lungs that can be used as a long-term bridging device. Methods: A total of eight goats weighing 40-55 kg were used. A membrane lung (Capiox EBS (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) accompanied by a centrifugal pump (Emersave (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was connected to the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk for outflow, and the left atrial (LA) appendage for inflow. The PA pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure (AP), pre- and post-oxygenator pressures were monitored. The blood flow of the main PA and the membrane lung were monitored continuously by using an ultrasonic perivascular probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY). The blood flow to the membrane lung was maintained at around 2.0 L/min during the trials. Results: Four out of eight goats did not survive because of initial surgical failures (N=2), and introducing air bubbles in the membrane lungs (N=2). Other four goats were successfully kept for device testing. Durations of the circuit run were 7, 16, 24, and 48 days with or without heparin infusions according to the experimental protocols. Mean AP and mean PAP at the recovery from the surgery were 81 +/- 16 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The PA flow rate was 4.4 +/- 0.5 L/min. Discussion: The animal model for testing long-term membrane lung application as PA-to-LA configuration has been established. The model makes it possible for us to assess artificial lungs in vivo setting for long-term with stable blood flow through the device. Objectives: The effectiveness of the inhaled drugs is strictly related to the areas which are reachable by the drug particles. Unless the particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence might not meet the required expectations and consequently the disease progress might not be stopped. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particles deposition of a standard inhaled drug, commonly used during the treatment of asthma, with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study was devoted to the analysis of the particles diameter influence on their deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Methods: Two patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old patients, were reconstructed basing on the DICOM image sets obtained during the Computed Tomography Examinations. The reconstruction of the digital models was performed within the Mimics Research 20.0 program, whereas the meshes were prepared with the use of the Ansys ICEM package. Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of 1.0-50.0 mu m). Results: It was proven that depending on the particles size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies significantly. The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20 mu m are gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of diameters 5-15 mu m are accumulating mainly on the trachea walls, leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles. Similar phenomena could be observed for both investigated cases of the reconstructed geometries. Discussion: The significant changes of the drug particle distribution resulting from the various diameters of the particles indicate that the inhaled drug size cannot be treated as negligible factor during the drug spraying. Improper distribution of the particles, i.e. their aggregation on the wall of the throat and trachea, might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma. Objectives: The improvement of immunosuppressive strategies have signifigantly reduced the risk and mortality of cellular rejection after Heart Transplantation (HTx). Recently, Humoral Rejection and antibodies have been recognized as a major problem in the management of recipients during the follow-up. Methods: 23 patients out of more than 700 recipients undergoing HTx and 6 undergoing retransplantation required techniques of apheretic medicine to manage Humoral Rejection episodes or to lead to transplant patients with Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA). Results: In our experience 4 patients were treated with photopheresis with excellent tolerability, no adverse event and no rejection episodes. Photopheresis was added on top of standard immunosuppressive therapy in patients requiring minimization of calcineurins due to other clinical conditions. 19 patients experiencing humoral rejection were treated alternatively with Plasma Exchange (8 patients) or with immunoadsorption. Plasma Exchange was preferred in acute patients requiring removal of inflammatory factors other than antibodies while Immunoabsorption was better tolerated and adopted to reduce the metabolic impact and coagulative disorders when the patient was more stable. Discussion: Apheretic Medicine has opened a new door and represents an efficient weapon in the armamentarium of an HTx center. The complexity of the management of this new diseased in frail patients highlights the need for a multidisciplinary group establishing the right treatment for every patient. Realheart TAH is designed to imitate the construction of the human heart in order to create a blood flow as natural as possible. Realheart TAH consists of two pumps, corresponding to the right and left side of the natural heart. It pumps blood from the left side and right side simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Each pump of the Realheart TAH consists of an atrium and a ventricle, with a valve cylinder in between. When the valve cylinder moves towards ventricle, the blood pumps out from the ventricle creating the systolic phase. The ventricle fills with blood when the valve cylinder moves towards the atrium creating a diastolic phase. The cardiac output of the Realheart TAH depends on the stroke length of the valve cylinder and the frequency of the movement. The left and right pump regulate cardiac output independently in order to coordinate the left/right flow balance of the circulatory system. Similar to natural heart, Realheart TAH is integrated into the circulatory system, which facilitates the uninterrupted blood flow to the atrium, when it pumps the blood out of the ventricle in pulses. The atrium is constructed with a compliance membrane to avoid blood suction from the veins during the systolic phase. Objectives: Pre-vascularized, fibrin-based implants that can be attached to the blood vessels in vivo are a promising solution to faster and more efficient vascularization of implants, to facilitate implant healing and survival. Here, low concentrated (up to 10mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels have been shown to promote tube formation of endothelial cells in co-culture with ASC. However, these fibrin hydrogels are fairly unstable and higher fibrin concentrations are necessary for implant fabrication. We investigated whether higher concentrated (20-40 mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels were suitable for tube formation and if perfusion of the hydrogels could support capillarization of a fibrin-based implant. Methods: Capillary formation of endothelial cells was tested in tube assays using fibrin concentrations of 1-30 mg/ml. Hydrogels were fabricated with cryoprecipitated fibrinogen from blood plasma that had been activated with thrombin. Gels were seeded with EC and ASC co-cultures, supplied with feeding medium containing pro-angiogenic factors, and cultivated for 7 days. Hydrogels with 40 mg/mL fibrin and pre-formed channels were cellularized with EC and ASC and perfused with feeding medium for 10 days under continuous flow. Results: In tube assays, only concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL fibrin were suitable for endothelial tube formation, which started after 2 days and peaked after 5 days in culture. Tubes were stable for the total assay duration of 7 days. However, under perfusion, fibrin gels of 40 mg/mL showed an endothelialized pore formation throughout the gel. Discussion: High-concentration fibrin hydrogels can successfully be capillarized by EC-ASC co-cultures and perfusion. In static conditions, only low-concentration fibrin hydrogels are suitable for tube formation. As the next step hydrogels of different concentrations are to be connected to fibrin vascular grafts and perfused as a whole implant construct using a custom-made flow chamber as mechanical support. Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the passage number and glucose concentration on viability of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in the culture flasks. Methods: The HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins obtained by Caesarean section. Cells after the 2nd and 7th passage were seeded with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Glucose concentration in the culture medium was kept constant at the normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) level or was switched every 24 hours from normal to high level or vice versa for 7 or 14 days. The cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) and activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using the flow cytometry (with propidium iodide, JC1 and DCFDA test, respectively). The glucose uptake and lactate production was also monitored. Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: After 7 days of culturing in medium with normal, high and variable glucose concentration the cell viability was higher respectively by 5%, 4% and 4% in the HUVEC passaged 7 times than in those passaged 2 times. After 14 days the differences were higher and equal to 21%, 21% and 31%, respectively. After 7 days Delta psi m was higher 1.3, 3.2 and 2.6 times in HUVEC after 7th passage than those after 2nd one, which were cultured in medium with the normal, high and variable glucose level, respectively. The glucose uptake and the lactate production were higher after 14 days and similar for all passages. The ROS activity was lower after 14 days of culturing for all cultures. Microscopic visualization of cells did not show any morphological differences. Discussion: The obtained results show that the properties and phenotype of HUVEC after the second passage are closer to the properties and phenotype of native cells. The HUVEC after the 7th passage are better adapted to in vitro conditions deviating from physiological conditions. One of the pillars for a more patient oriented healthcare is found in patient individualised medicine. Custom-made implants tailored to the individual's specific requirements is one of the key elements herein to obtain better outcomes. However, the production of patient individualised implants is nowadays still often related to a high rate of manual processes, causing both high cost and long delivery periods. Technical innovations play a crucial role in introducing these patient individualised therapy options into clinical prac-tice. Advances in medical imaging and the evolution of new production technologies (e.g. additive manufacturing) build the basis for a time and cost effective production of implants of lot size one at industrial-scale level. Combining these aspects with digitalisation leads to the potential of a new era of patient individualised implants and appropriate business models. It is crucial to systematically review and adapt the data management and data processing throughout the entire value chain in order to achieve the goal of a more patient individualised care. Different tools are used to de-fine interfaces, actors, data types throughout the entire process and methods need to be established for the data pro-cessing itself. A digital process chain from diagnosis to the actual delivery of a custom-made implant to the hospital including the manufacturing process is established. The underlying principles and assumptions used are exemplarily shown. The digital process chain is used to pave the way from science into a successful business model and company, in order to introduce these patient individualised implants to achieve a better patient care. The use of technical and medical progresses in combination with digitalisation is used to obtain a new generation of patient individualised implants. The way from science to start-up within this field is presented. Objectives: There are currently no available noninvasive methods that allow for the simultaneous and reliable measure of cardiac output (CO) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the arterial tree. Both of those indices are important biomarkers of cardiovascular status. Methods: Radial pressure profiles were recorded using applanation tonometry in a group of healthy subjects (N=18) and hemodialysis patients (N=30). Recorded pulse waves were used to estimate patient-specific parameters of the mathematical model describing the blood flow in the system of 55 major arteries. Calibration of the model with patient data allowed to calculate patient-specific CO and PWV between any two points in the arterial tree. In all of the patients and healthy subjects we performed additional measurements of PWV using ECG gated applanation tonometry at two arterial sites (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) and CO using bioimpedance cardiography (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical). Results: The model was able to reproduce all of the recorded pressure profiles with high accuracy (average relative error < 10%). Model-estimated PWV highly correlated with the one measured using SphygmoCor device (R = 0.75, p-value < 0.001). Model-predicted CO also correlated with the one measured by the bioimpedance cardiography, but at a lower level (R = 0.52, p-value <0.001). Discussion: Our study demonstrates that coupling a mathematical model with a single peripheral pressure profile has the potential to provide information about cardiovascular state that was previously only available when using more complicated methods. Objectives: The purpose of this work is the study of biocompatibility for samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue engineering constructions for layer-by-layer repair of tissues of heart and blood vessels. Samples components are albumin, collagen and chitosan as matrices and carbon nanotubes as reinforcement. Three-dimensional structures are formed in layers by laser printing. Methods: The biocompatibility of the samples and layers of their components was evaluated after their incubation with endothelial cells for 72 hours. Cell morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative analysis was performed using MTT-test and real-time cell analysis by means of electrical impedance monitoring. For in vivo studies, samples were implanted in breasts of laboratory birds. Results: It has been established that the layer consisting of albumin and nanotubes supports proliferation of cells the most. Moreover, all layers have surface properties that provide cell adhesion. Real-time cell analysis showed improved cell proliferation compared to control during the entire incubation time, however the greatest differences were observed after 25 hours of incubation. The morphology of the cells on the samples corresponds to the morphology of the control cells. With implantation of samples in experimental animals, the absence of their toxicity was observed. Discussion: Samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue-engineering structures are biocompatible because of characteristics of their components and suitable surface structure. The obtained samples can be used to repair damages in cardiovascular system. Due to the method of laser printing, samples can be made in any form, taking into account the features of the damaged area of tissues. Objectives: The blood flow rate is the only parameter that can be controlled during the operation of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator that significantly influences the gas exchange rate. Due to anatomical size restrictions, the catheter is of limited size and the tight packaging does not allow for placement of a dedicated flow rate sensor. Therefore, for a flow rate control system, the correct estimation of the blood flow rate is essential. In this work, a system specific flow rate estimation method is presented based on motor current and motor speed measurements. Methods: A training data set of motor current - I and rotational speed - omega, as well as volumetric flow rate - Q were recorded in an in-vitro model of the intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. A 40/60 water/glycerol mixture was used to approximate the dynamic properties of blood. The rotational speed of the motor was varied in a range of 10000 to 30000 RPM. For each motor speed, the hydraulic resistance of the system was varied with a throttle resulting in different flow rate values. Additionally, a test data set was acquired consisting of different rotational speed, hydraulic resistance, and flow rate triplets. The I, omega and Q training data was used to construct a fitting surface of the type Q(I, omega) by a regularized cubic spline least-squares approximation method. The surface was defined in a grid of 591x591 points with Imin=-70 mA, Imax=520 mA, omega min=500 RPM, omega max=30000 RPM. The test set of I - omega pairs was then used to predict Q by means of a nearest neighbor search in the modeled surface. Results: A correlation coefficient of r=0.96 was achieved between the estimated and measured flow rates of the water/glycerol mixture. Discussion: The strong correlation between estimated and measured flow rate suggests that sensorless flow rate control is possible. Objectives: Developing new bioinks that are able to meet the crucial requirements for 3D bioprinting of different tissues has emerged recently as an important topic in the field of biomaterials. In this work, linear chains of hyaluronic acid (HA) were hydrophobically modified using hexadecyl short chains. The rheological properties as well as the 3D printability were investigated. Methods: HA of Mw = 76.6 kDa was hydrophobically modified by conjugation of parts of its primary hydroxyl groups with hexadecyl chains in two steps. The ratio of substitution was determined using 1HNMR spectroscopy. Two different hydrogels were prepared at polymer concentration of 0.4 and 1.6 wt%. The rheological properties of both hydrogels were investigated using continuous flow experiment and cyclic strain time sweep experiment. Furthermore, the 3D printability of the hydrogels was studied using an extrusion-based 3D printer. Results: 1H NMR spectrum of the new product revealed that the substitution ratio was 40 mol%. Furthermore, the modified polymer was able to form sable hydrogels at both polymer concentrations whereas unmodified HA was unable to form hydrogel at the same concentrations. The rheological experiments showed decreasing of hydrogels viscosity by increasing the shearing rate which points toward a shear thinning property. Both hydrogels showed sharp decreases in the storage moduli upon applying high strains. The hydrogel prepared using 2.6 wt% of the modified polymer showed, however, higher shape-fidelity for 3D printing compared to hydrogel at polymer concentration of 0.4 wt%. Discussion: Hydrophobic modification of HA using relatively short alkyl chains enables physical crosslinking between polymer chains to produce biocompatible and 3D-printable hydrogel using low concentration of modified polymer. The rheological properties suggest their suitability as ink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting Objectives: High resolution imaging of living cells is impaired by artefacts introduced by chemical fixation and by the rapid movement of molecules during live cell imaging. We have therefore developed tools to cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope and image them by high- and super-resolution microscopy. However, the developed equipment is also applicable to investigate the process of cryopreservation. Methods: We have developed two different microscope cryo-stages that allow for continuous observation on the fluorescence microscope. One stage allows for relatively slow controlled cooling (<50 degrees C/min) and warming (<150 degrees C/min) of cells. It allows for medium exchange during cooling and warming and thus for change of concentration of cryoprotective agents. Due to the design of this microscope stage, oil immersion objectives can be used down to at least -45 degrees C. The second stage is designed to ultra-rapidly cool cells with >10000 degrees C/s to temperatures Results: We established a protocol to reversibly cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope stage. This permits to image physiological processes in the same living cells with practically unlimited acquisition time at consecutive points in time. This allowed for super-resolution imaging and microspectroscopy measurements, which were impeded at physiological temperatures, because of the dynamics of cellular molecules. The development of a device to ultra-rapidly cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope under continuous observation allowed for the investigation of cells, which have been cryo-arrested/vitrified within Discussion: The presented cryo-fixations methods enable a more precise measurement of molecular patterns and thus a better understanding of molecular organization in cells under physiological conditions. The developed microscopy stages should however also enable high- and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of molecular processes in cells during the process of cryopreservation. Objectives: The aim of this work is to provide a general overview of the design challenges in the wireless powering of artificial organs, to develop a general design strategy for inductive powering units (IPU), and to design a prototype IPU for mid-power application with high-stable output characteristic. Methods: Artificial organs can benefit greatly from inductive wireless powering, but there are several major design challenges which must be overcome. The high energy transfer efficiency must be ensured. The IPU must tolerate coils misalignments. Tissue overheating must be avoided. Biocompatible materials must be used. Size and weight restrictions must be taken into account. Finally, patient body specifics should be considered. We have developed a new general design strategy in which all mentioned problems are addressed. The main feature is that we simultaneously optimize the inductive link and the schematics of the transmitter and the receiver and take the body specific elements (the thickness of the skin and the fat layer) into account. We have developed strictly formal procedures which can be implemented using software in computer-aided design procedures. Results: In order to test and verify our approach we have designed a prototype IPU. The design goal was set as follows: IPU must ensure output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignments up to 20 mm. The design goal was achieved. Several coil couples were used to adjust optimal energy transfer distance to the expected implantation depth. Measurements were performed in the air as well as with the samples of \"skin-fat\" biological objects were performed. Discussion: We have developed and tested design strategy for biomedical IPU which can provide reliable design adjusted to the various requirements and the specific of the patient's body. Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) and HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA) clinically revealed a significantly different thrombogenic profile. In detail, while the HM3 has abated incidence of pump thrombosis, it was not associated with reduced stroke incidence. We numerically characterized and compared prothrombotic flow characteristics of the two pumps to provide mechanistic insights into observed clinical outcomes. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to evaluate flow fields associated with periodic speed modulation in the two pumps (the artificial pulse for the HM3 and the Lavare cycle for the HVAD). One-way coupling to a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system was employed to account for physiologic boundary conditions. Results were compared to baseline simulations with constant pressure head and rotor speed to comprehensively evaluate geometrical and speed modulation effects. Analysis of the thrombogenic potential was based on calculation of: i) a specific platelet activation marker, the Platelet Activity State (PAS), using time course of viscous and Reynolds stress computed on platelet trajectories probed using Lagrangian particle tracking, ii) scalar washout, iii) volumes of flow stagnation, and iv) wall shear stress patterns. Results: The HM3 and HVAD showed different PAS distribution. Speed modulation was associated with increased sum of viscous and Reynolds stresses and PAS magnitude. Analysis of temporal and spatial gradients of the shear stress histories calculated on platelet trajectories, volumes of stagnation, and wall shear stresses allowed identification of geometrical and operating parameters that might contribute to pump thrombogenicity and pump washout Discussion: We compared prothrombotic fluid dynamic features of the HM3 and HVAD under realistic dynamic operating conditions. Our results provide a \"numerical rationale\" for the observed clinical outcomes. Objectives: Over time left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become an alternative to heart transplantation because of enormous technical development and miniaturization. Implantation of these systems has been proven to lead to considerably improved survival, with an increase in quality of life. Following implantation, most patients display a considerable improvement in physical capacity, measured according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, even though exercise tolerance levels following the implantation of an LVAD are still considerably restricted. Methods: Current state of scientific knowledge with respect to the physical capacity of patients with terminal heart failure after LVAD implantation is described at rest and during exercise. The significance of new diagnostic tools, such as the non-invasive inert gas rebreathing method for measurement of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) in assessment of the performance of LVAD patients is discussed. Results: Pump flow across the LVAD can be increased to a certain degree during exercise and normal everyday activities via two mechanisms: exercise-dependent tachycardia and increase of enddiastolic pressure in the left ventricle in conjunction with increased preloading. The share of the native left ventricle in systemic perfusion can also increase during exercise. Here, left-ventricular pressure exceeds systemic blood pressure and the aortic valve opens. The contractile reserve of the myocardium does, of course, play a crucial role. Discussion: Ultimately, the cardiopulmonary capacity of LVAD patients is restricted to a higher degree during exercise, even after implantation. Larger studies are required to clarify the extent to which longer-term physical exercise training after discharge from rehabilitation and/or an increase in the number of pump rotations can lead to increased physical capacity in LVAD patients. Objectives: The epidemiology of heart failure (HF) is a rising medical burden with an estimated growing rate of 46% from 2012 to 2030. Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and minimally invasive techniques are nowadays key therapies to guarantee optimal treatments for each HF patient. So far, clinical experience with minimally-invasive LVAD surgery showed promising short-term results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term results of the first series of patients who received minimally-invasive LVAD surgery at our institution. Methods: We reviewed the short and long term outcomes of 111 end-stage HF patients who received an LVAD implantation (HVAD, HeartWare, Medtronic, USA) at our institution between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent an upper hemisternotomy and left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 111 minimally-invasive LVAD implantations were performed at our institution (78% male, 22% female; mean age 52 +/- 4; dilated cardiomyopathy 42.6%; ischaemic cardiomyopathy 44.4%, other aetiologies 13%). Postoperative bleeding incidence was 9.6% leading to a low amount of applied packed red blood cells (mean: 4.9 rbc), short ICU stay (mean 9.3 days), and a low incidence of right heart failure (4.6%). Thirty-day mortality was 5.2%, 90-day mortality 9.0% and 1-year survival 88%. Long-term follow-up (median 6.4 years) demonstrated a mortality of 51,4%, a transplant rate of 16.4%, and an explant rate of 1,7%. 15.8% of patients underwent pump exchange and 30,3% of patients had still an ongoing LVAD therapy at the time of follow-up. Discussion: Minimally-invasive LVAD implantations are proven to be safe and associated with a lower perioperative complication and mortality rate. By using an upper hemisternotomy with an anterolateral thoracotomy, the intra-hospital outcomes showed promising results impacting also the long-term follow-up which presented an excellent percentage of ongoing LVAD therapies. Objectives: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) provides fast and label-free analysis of living cells by minimized interaction with the sample. The analysis of QPM images enables the determination of morphological cell parameters like cell thickness and elongation and facilitates single cell tracking for migration analysis. Methods: To demonstrate the potential of QPM in determining the metastatic potential of cells, we have developed a fully automated QPM system utilizing digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in an off-axis Mach-Zehnder configuration. Different pancreatic tumor cell lines, beating heart cells, white blood cells and in vitro toxicology models were analyzed for refraction index, cell volume, cell area, dry mass and cell morphology dependent processes. Results: The morphological analysis of the different cell lines via QPM in combination with image segmentation-based evaluation of the retrieved quantitative phase images showed that QPI could identify and quantify cell types and cellular processes by cell specific properties as cell proliferation, cell death, 3D cell migration or cell height. E. g. cells with a high metastatic potential had a lower cell thickness and a higher elongation than cells with a low metastatic potential. Moreover, computer assisted tracking of single cells showed that highly metastatic cells covered a longer distance and had a higher motility compared to cells with a low metastatic potential. Also white blood cell types and disease or drug induced morphological blood cell alterations could be separated. Discussion: In summary, the multi-functional potential of QPM in various cell biological applications as cancer cell or stem cell research, toxicological and pharmacological screenings and cell quality control represents a promising new approach for a fast and label free phenotyping of different cell types and cellular processes. QPM meets the growing interest in label-free, optical techniques minimizing samples interaction. Objectives: Severe life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be caused by exceptionally wide range of clinical conditions. Currently, donor platelet (PLT) transfusion is the only efficient clinical approach to successfully treat thrombocytopenia. However, PLT transfusion is challenged by adverse immune responses and is limited the short shelf life of donated material. Previously, we showed the feasibility to generate iPSC-derived MKs in a large scale, which can be used as an alternative to conventional PLT transfusion. However, success of this perspective therapeutic approach requires efficient biobanking technologies that would allow long-term storage and accumulation of MKs in clinically sufficient amounts. In this study, we aimed at the development of an optimal biobanking strategies for the preservation of iPSC-derived MKs. Methods: Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and propane-1,2-diol (PD) were evaluated for their cryoprotective efficiency in iPSC-derived MKs. Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of MKs before and after cryopreservation was performed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Capability of cryopreserved MKs to form proPLTs and release functional PLTs has been tested in vitro. Transfusion into animal model has been performed to evaluate capability of MKs to release PLTs in vivo. Results and Discussion: Application of developed cryopreservation procedures allowed recovery of over 80% of iPSC-derived MKs cryopreserved with Me2SO and PD. Recovered cell populations expressed typical MK markers, including CD41, CD61, and CD42a and showed high polyploidy. Moreover, cryopreserved MKs showed the capability to form proPLTs and release PLTs in vitro as well as in vivo after transfusion in animal model. Present findings propose efficient clinically relevant biobanking strategies necessary for progress in MK-based regenerative and replacement approaches. Objectives: Adverse events due to flow-induced blood damage remain a serious problem for blood pumps as cardiac support systems. The numerical prediction of blood damage via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a helpful tool for the design and optimization of reliable pumps. Blood damage prediction models primarily are based on the acting shear stresses, which are calculated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on computational grids. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of the spatial discretization and the associated discretization error on the shear stress calculation in a blood pump in comparison to other important flow quantities like the pressure head of the pump. Methods: CFD analysis using seven Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations were performed. Two simple stress calculation indicators were applied to estimate the influence of the discretization on the results using an approach to calculate numerical uncertainties, which indicates discretization errors. Results: For the finest grid with 19 million elements, numerical uncertainties up to 20 % for shear stresses were determined, while the pressure heads show smaller uncertainties with a maximum of 4.8 %. Discussion: No grid-independent solution for velocity gradient-dependent variables could be obtained on a grid size that is comparable to mesh sizes in state-of-the-art blood pump studies. It can be concluded that the grid size has a major influence on the shear stress calculation, and therefore the potential blood damage prediction, and that the quantification of this error should always be taken into account. Objectives: The piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a promising property to be considered when controlling the diffusion of ions through membranes. This study examines the impact of different solvents and their ratios on the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and on the diffusion rates of fiber membranes. Methods: Fiber mats were polarized via electrospinning using 20w% PVDF solutions with solvent mixtures of dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as first solvent and acetone or methyl acetate (MeOAc) as second solvent in different ratios. Conversion of non-polar alpha-phase into polar beta-phase was evaluated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Diffusion experiments were performed by measuring changes in conductivity of deionized water (1.5 mu S/cm) for 150min under static and cyclic loading conditions. Results: Polymer solutions showed a non-Newtonian behavior. An increasing acetone ratio led to decreasing densities in PVDF solutions. Densities remained unchanged for all MeOAc ratios. FTIR results for MeOAc-solubilized PVDF fiber mats showed lower intensity of alpha-phase peaks at 762cm(-1) as compared to acetone solubilized ones. The intensity of the characteristic 840cm(-1) polar beta-phase peak rose with a higher ratio of the second solvent. Diffusion experiments with piezoelectric PVDF membranes (n=5) inhibited sodium chloride diffusion under static conditions (67 mu S/cm) while induction of the direct piezoelectric effect allowed for increased diffusion (533 mu S/cm). Discussion: Solvent properties and ratios influence the intrinsic properties of PVDF solutions for electrospinning and consequently affect beta-phase conversion. Especially, MeOAc in combination with DMF or DMAc has a positive effect on piezoelectric beta-phase conversion. With suitable process parameters, piezoelectric fiber mats can be produced for active filter membranes. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate their molecular weight cut-off properties. Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) is an auditory neuroprosthesis used to restore hearing in deaf and profoundly deaf patients. It features an electrode array (EA) which needs to be inserted into the inner ear (cochlea) to enable electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Spatial proximity of the EA and the nerve fibers is considered beneficial. This requires a shape change of the initially straight EA to enclose the inner wall of the spiral-shaped inner ear after implantation. Thin wires made of Nitinol-a shape memory alloy (SMA)-are investigated regarding their applicability as embedded actuators to implement a shape change. Methods: Nitinol wires ( null 100 mu m) have been trained to a spiral shape which was derived from cross-sectional images of a human specimen as an exemplary adaption to a specific cochlea geometry. Ten different variations of thermomechanical processing were applied by the supplier (G.RAU GmbH & Co. KG) to tailor the shape memory effect to the application specific requirements. In order to determine the resulting transformation temperatures (AS, AF) a bend and free recovery (BFR) test suitable for curved wires was developed and utilized. Results: It is possible to design and fabricate spiral-shaped SMA wires which fit to a specific cochlea shape. The developed BFR test setup allows for measuring the thermomechanical properties of these actuators in an application oriented manner. This provides slightly higher but more realistic measures for AS and AF compared to differential scanning calorimetry. Discussion: A complete design, manufacturing and validation process for thin spiral shape memory wires could be established. The next step is to integrate these wires into an EA and perform BFR measurements again as it is known that external forces due to stiffness of the EA alter the transformation temperatures. Objectives: The purpose of the work is to develop a theoretical basis for determining the thickness of the laminar boundary layer in the nasal cavity during respiration. Methods: Methods for obtaining basic scientific and practical results are based on the general principles of theoretical physics and aerodynamics in order to determine the laminar boundary layer of air flow in the upper respiratory tract. Results: Using the aerodynamic approach to the study of respiratory and olfactory disorders revealed that the thickness of the laminar boundary layer decreases with decreasing equivalent diameter of the nasal cavity and with increasing Reynolds number, which characterizes the degree of turbulence in the air flow. Typical values of the thickness of the laminar boundary layer are in the range of 0.2-0.05 mm, depending on the mode of nasal breathing and the configuration of the nasal cavity. The data obtained characterizes the effect of airflow on the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity: if the heterogeneity of the mucosal surface extends beyond the boundary of the laminar boundary layer, then such portions of the nasal cavity are exposed to turbulent flow, which leads to overdrying. The size of the heterogeneities of the mucosa is determined by tomographic data during their processing at the sub-pixel level, which allows for the investigation of the effect of the intensity of the boundary elements of the walls of the nasal passages. Discussion: A model of the distribution of airflow velocities in the nasal cavity in the turbulent mode is proposed; it has a logarithmic or power profile cross section, and within the laminar boundary layer the air velocity increases linearly to almost the max value. The current air velocity in the cross sections amounted to 5-7 m/s. The feature of the developed method is transitioned to hydraulic diameter, which takes into account complex configuration of the nasal cavity, as well as an anatomically narrow area - the olfactory slit. Objectives: Bioengineering of elements of the musculo-skeletal system is rich in studies concerning bone reconstruction. Among them, the culture of cells on a osteogenic electrospun scaffold under dynamic conditions is an interesting option. However, one should also consider the reconstruction of tendon and muscle finally mimicking a continuum from bone to muscle. Methods: Poly-caprolactone (PCL) 10% was electrospun on a rotating collector whose velocity varied to get random or aligned nanofibers. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and C2C12 cells were respectively seeded on the materials. Mechanical or electrical stresses were applied to the biohybrid scaffolds to differentiate cells towards tendon's or muscle's phenotypes, in the absence any specific biochemical factors. Results: After 2 weeks of culture under dynamic stretching (1Hz, 4% strain for an hour followed by 11h of rest), BMSCs were found to align in the stretching direction, presented increased levels of tenomodulin and neosynthetized collagen, compared to static conditions. C2C12 differentiation until aligned myotubes stage was more difficult to achieve. We proposed to add a PEG microstructure to guide cell growth. Combined to electrical stimulation, it led to the cells fusion into very long myotubes hosting many nuclei, as expected. Discussion: In this study, we managed to grow two different types of cells and generate their differentiation towards tendon and muscle lineage, in the absence of any differentiation factors. The next step is to implement the co-culture on different areas of the same electrospun scaffold, to let the cells proliferate and study the events occurring at the junction. Objectives: Alarm fatigue is a safety and quality problem where exposure to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to cognitive bias or slowed response to alarms. One reason for alarm fatigue is false pressure alarms during extracorporeal blood therapies. It is clear that current machine algorithms based on simple threshold monitoring must be replaced by intelligent algorithms that avoid any false positive alarm. Methods: Detailed analysis of arterial pressure, venous pressure, transmembrane pressure, ultrafiltration rate and relative blood volume during hemodialysis was performed using a patient data base. Main causes of pressure alarms were identified, analysed and replicated during simulated hemodialysis therapies with a FMC 4008 hemodialysis device and a patient simulator. Results: Data analysis shows clear evidence that even slowly drifting adaptive baseline alarms which are currently in use lead to false positive alarms with a high probability during nearly every treatment. Pressure variations which are induced by local flow and blood viscosity changes can be identified reliably by use of algorithms based on pattern recognition. Pressure variations from patient movements and changes in blood pressure show a different pattern that can be used to distinguish between true alarm events and false positive events. Discussion: For 25 years, it has been known that alarm systems which monitor whether a threshold value is exceeded have a rate of false alarms of 77-99,5% depending on the physiologic parameter monitored (Wiklund et al., 1994). New adaptive algorithms based on pattern recognition principles help to combine both maximum patient safety and avoidance of false positive pressure alarms. Objectives: In vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues \"Biotubes\" constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of the recipients exhibited superior functions. However, since the formation of the vascular tissues depends on the recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) were attempted to improve their initial mechanical durability. Last year, we reported that ET and GA increased the burst pressure of the tissues and did not affect their suture retention strength. This year, we measured 3 parameters of mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate strain (%) and Young's modulus. Methods: Tubular tissues (ID: 5 mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks, n=3) were separated to the 3 groups, raw tissue group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with 70% ET (ET) for 10 min and crosslinking with 0.6% GA (GA) for 10 min. We measured 3 parameters shown above, by tissue ringlet pull test. Results: There were no significant differences in UTS (RAW: 3.765 +/- 0.662 MPa, ET: 4.330 +/- 0.619 MPa, GA: 3.763 +/- 0.438 MPa, p=0.409) or ultimate strain (RAW: 30.15 +/- 1.60 %, ET: 41.22 +/- 6.11 %, GA: 37.73 +/- 4.36 %, p=0.209) between the 3 groups. Young's modulus of ET group was significantly higher among the 3 groups (RAW: 5.41 +/- 1.16 MPa, ET: 12.28 +/- 2.55 MPa, GA: 7.65 +/- 1.18 MPa, p= 0.0289). Discussion: Short period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to control the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues to produce the ideal grafts in mechanical aspects. Objectives: Stent graft development is one of the most important topics for countries with a large number of elderly people. However, very little research has been carried out using model circulation of the aortic dissection. Quantitative evaluation and development have been difficult, because there was no model. Methods: In this study, a fluid dynamical circuit model circulation simulating the left heart circulation of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was developed with a pulsatile blood pump. Various shapes of the inflow side and outflow side for the pseudo lumen were used in the experimental series. Furthermore, an animal model of the dissecting aneurysm was developed using a mechanical dissecting method and flow patterns of the animal aortas with the model dissecting aneurysm, after the ethical committee's approval. Flow and pressure pattern time series data was recorded in the digital recorder and a quantitative evaluation was carried out. Results: Flow of the true lumen and pseudo lumen was divided with a thin membrane. Various amounts of the flow and pressure was observed and recorded. Membrane of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was simulated with rubber sheet. After the insertion of the aortic stent, the shapes of the flow and pressure pattern were altered. Animal experiments to develop the dissecting aneurysm were difficult. Firstly the aorta of the goats was removed, and then the dissecting aneurysm was to be constructed by the detachment of the tunica media of the aortic wall. Flow pattern of the experimental Aorta was recorded. Discussion: Quantitative evaluation of the Aortic Stent expanding performance and pressure and flow pattern in the true and pseudo lumen had been observed in the mock circulation loop. Furthermore, animal model of the dissecting aorta will be useful material for the development of the stent graft in the near future. Objectives: The aim of this work is to investigate the performance of the RealHeart (TM)psi total artificial heart (TAH) with a hybrid cardiac simulator (HCS). Methods: The HCS, developed at the Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, is a computational-hydraulic model of the cardiovascular system. Four hydro-numerical interfaces reproduced the pressure/flow profiles of atria, pulmonary artery, and aorta hydraulically, while the rest of the circulation was numerical. The TAH was connected accordingly. The TAH is a pulsatile 4-chamber device whose left and right sides can operate independently, by changing pulse rate (PR) and stroke length (SL). The TAH was tested on the HCS at low/medium operating points: PR 60/80/100/120 bpm; SL 20/22/24/26 mm; systole duration ratio 0.4 of the TAH cycle. Systemic resistance was changed between 0.8 and 1.2 mmHg/(ml/s), pulmonary resistance was changed between 0.1 and 0.2 mmHg/(ml/s). Systemic and pulmonary compliances were set to 1.4 ml/mmHg. Results: The independent tuning of PR and SL permits fine regulation the TAH flow on the left and right sides. As an example, for a peripheral resistance of 1.0 mmHg/(ml/s) the flow ranged from 2.7 l/min (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 7.0 l/min (PS=120,SL=26mm). For the investigated PRs and SLs, power consumption on the left pump ranged between 1.3 and 10.0 Watts and on the right pump between 0.9 and 6.0 Watts. The TAH provides a pulsatile flow, whose waveform depends on the SL and systole duration. This induced a pressure pulsatility ranging from 10mmHg (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 38 mmHg (PR=120,SL=26mm) in both the aorta and pulmonary artery. Discussion: The HCS is a flexible test bench to evaluate the TAH performance in different hemodynamic conditions. The tuning of PR and SL on the left and right side of the TAH, independently, offers flexibility in regulating cardiac output and in managing the left/right flow balance. Power consumption is in the range suitable for clinical applications. Objectives: In case of chronic mechanical circulatory support, it is highly desirable to fully understand the interaction between the beating left ventricle and the VAD in order to potentially reduce adverse events. Thus, we took the VAD's perspective and investigated the flow inside a VAD in an advanced development status during the time course of a heartbeat. Methods: The study is conducted with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applying realistic pressure boundary conditions for left ventricular and arterial pressure and the results are compared to results produced with an established, active mock circulation loop. Due to the high resolution in time and space and the use of sliding mesh interfaces, local flow phenomena during different phases of systole and diastole are unmasked. The effects of inertia in the pump and cannulae become evident, which are not modeled in more traditional VAD flow simulations with steady-state boundary conditions. Results: The results show that hysteresis effects due to inertia are quantitatively of high importance. The hysteresis curves of the VAD operational point obtained experimentally and numerically correlate well. Moreover, the results show that a VAD design for a highly pulsed flow can lead to a situation, where almost no remaining stagnation zones, as quantified with a numerical stagnation index, exist during a heartbeat. Discussion: Despite increased computational costs, highly resolved CFD simulations in time and space with realistic time-varying boundary conditions are a powerful tool to increase understanding of the interaction of the mechanically supported circulation and the device itself. This enabled a verification of a VAD design with low to almost non-existing flow stagnation at constant rotational speed. This finding correlates well with the fact that the VAD does not require any anticoagulation in chronic animal trial testing lasting weeks to months. Objectives: The friction properties for the contact between contact lenses and the eyelid are the focus of current research in order to optimize the wearing comfort. The tribological system consisting of contact lense, eyelid and tear fluid should be considered. Suitable measurement conditions must be used for the examinations. Methods: In this research the nano- and microtribological friction properties of hard and soft (hydrogel) contact lenses were investigated. The friction conditions were investigated by nano scratch test; moreover, a nanotribometer was used to evaluate the frictional properties during sliding on the lenses. Contact lens fluid was applied as lubricant for both cases. Results: The friction coefficients of hard contact lenses and hydrogel lenses were detected for a range of speeds and loads. It was possible to examine the differences of the both contact lenses in detail. For the nano scratch and friction tests, there is a dependency of speed and normal force. Discussion: In case of nano-scratch tests, the frictional properties were investigated wile ploughing. This case shows the elastic- and plastic material properties besides the friction. In the case of the frictional tests, the measuring tip slides without ploughing. Due to the lubrication conditions, the soft hydrogel lenses feature a much lower friction coefficient. In case of the hard contact lenses, the coefficient of friction is comparable to the nano scratch test, as there is no lubrication film between both measuring tips and the contact lens. For further work it is mandatory to work under standazdized measurement conditions. Objectives: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) show an increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity mainly due to the accumulation of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Dialysis therapies have been optimized for the removal of low-molecular weight water-soluble and unbound uremic retention solutes, but not for protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Therefore, there is a strong need to increase the portion of unbound fractions in order to increase the clearance for these uremic toxins. Methods: We developed dialysis techniques where the protein-bound uremic retention solutes are removed more efficiently under high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields. The protein integrity of proteins and enzymatic activities were analysed. Results: The protein-bound fraction of phenylacetic acid, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate was significantly decreased by using high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields Discussion: Although protein-bound uremic retention solutes have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, the clearance of these solutes by conventional extracorporeal therapies is low until now. These uremic toxins bind to plasma proteins with a molecular weight greater than the cut-off of dialysis membranes and therefore conventional dialysis therapies do not sufficiently remove protein-bound uremic toxins. Disruption of association with protein and uremic solute is one possibility to significantly improve the removal of protein-bound uremic toxins. Therefore, we developed approaches for an increased release protein-bound uremic retention solutes from their protein-binding resulting in an increased clearance. Conclusion: Improvements of therapies for CKD patients are essential. Especial the consideration of removing hydrophobic protein-bound uremic toxins via new methods like application of high-electric fields or increased ionic strength is a further progress Objectives: Tissue decellularization is one of the novel techniques in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for obtaining extracellular matrix, which doesn't preserve mechanical properties of native tissue. Modified by the extracellular matrix, silk fibroin scaffolds can combine high biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. Methods: Wistar rats were used as liver donors. Decellularization of liver tissue was performed by sequential incubation with three solutions of 0,1% SDS containing Triton X-100 in the following concentrations: 1%, 2% and 3%. Livers were ground in liquid nitrogen and a certain fraction of microparticles was separated by precipitation and centrifugation. Silk fibroin scaffolds were prepared by a casting method using water as a solvent. Microparticle suspension was blended with fibroin solution before film preparation. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning probe nanotomography (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cytotoxicity of scaffolds, cell adhesion and proliferation were evaluated. Modified scaffolds were used as wound coatings in a full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Microparticles with a size less than 5 mu m were prepared from decellularized liver tissue. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained. Sinuous and rough topography of the obtained matrix was shown. The produced scaffolds did not show cytotoxic effect. The cells adhesion was significantly higher on scaffolds modified with decellularized liver tissue microparticles in comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds promoted skin wound regeneration by 30% in comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Discussion: Regenerative potential of extracellular matrix as microparticles was shown. Decellularization of organs and tissues may be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for increasing the biocompatibility of the artificial grafts. Hemodialysis is an important therapy for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients if a donor kidney is not available. During four hours of conventional therapy, three times a week, mainly small water-soluble toxins and a limited number of middle molecules are effectively removed from the patients' blood [1]. Besides, the therapy is non-continuous, causing large fluctuations in water balance and uremic waste, potassium and phosphate. Therefore, in recent years, many developments are focussed on longer treatment times, such as, nocturnal dialysis or application of a portable or wearable artificial kidney (PAK or WAK respectively). The continuous therapy outside the hospital requires application of membranes with long-term selectivity, fouling resistance and blood compatibility as well as demands reduced amount of water. In fact, for WAK, a small volume of spent dialysate should be continuously regenerated and reused. In this lecture, we will discuss all these important issues, including: Strategies for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate since the continuous recirculation of the dialysate for prolonged time demands additional efforts to avoid microbial contamination, without extra water consumption and without affecting the overall weight of the system. Strategies for achieving dialysate regeneration and especially urea removal since its daily molar production is higher than that of other waste solutes. Objectives: Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used therapy for end stage heart failure patients. Pump thrombosis is one of the most common problems in patients supported by an LVAD. Two types of thrombus can be distinguished: white thrombi and red thrombi. The only available option to combat a PT is a lysis therapy or a pump exchange. The objective of the presented study is to develop a relevant white pump thrombus model to promote development of these concepts. Methods: We developed an in vitro mock circulation system. The artificial blood circulation is provided by a HVAD. The HVAD pumps 80ml of human blood through the silicone loop. Parameters for inducing the white thrombus are high shear stress (4000 revolutions per minute), a rougher surface of the rotor, and an added activator of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. After two hours, the HVAD-system was checked for a white thrombus. Generated thrombi were stored for subsequent analysis (scanning electron microscopy and mechanical stability). Results: Thrombus generation was reproducible in number and geometry. After ten test runs, 23 thrombi were detected. All these generated thrombi had a minimal size of 12 mm(2). The developed thrombi are very similar in structure compared to white patient thrombi explanted in clinic. The scanning electron microscope showed a fibrin net on the surface of all tested thrombi (n=5). All tested thrombi samples (n=5) resist high strength (max. 1.029 MPa) in compression tests, which is typical for white PT. Discussion: The size of the thrombus should be increased for special investigational needs. A protocol was developed for reproducible and reliable production of white, shear induced thrombi for lysis therapy investigations. In addition, the similarity (biological structure, mechanical stability) to explanted patient thrombi was shown. However, additional analyses should be performed for further characterization of the artificial thrombi. Patient-specific anatomies can be reconstructed with a precision of approximately 0.5mm, using state of the art imaging modalities. This refers both to hard and soft tissues, hence with applications in clinical domains such as orthopedics, dentistry, cardiovascular surgery. Datamining techniques such as statistical shape modeling support the generation of biofidelic computer models. However, these models have to be fed with accurate data to reflect not only the geometry but also the material properties, the loading conditions and the interface between implants and bone in case of prosthetic reconstruction. The challenge is to optimize the interface between host tissue and implant in order to achieve maximum long-term functionality, but this optimization is also dependent on the optimization of the interfacing between the implant, the surgeon and the host tissue. Thus also the surgical technique will benefit from engineering support. Biomedical engineering is a key player to achieve this. A good geometric fit between implant and host tissue will ensure optimal initial stability. Patient-specific implants can ensure this stability, incorporating solid and porous structures where needed. Pre-operative computer assisted planning allows to optimize the surgical intervention, incorporating patient-specific biomechanical models to predict the functional outcome of the surgical intervention. And finally, in order to achieve that the pre-operative plan is accurately transferred into the surgical practice, computer assisted surgery enabled by e.g. navigation, robotics of patient-specific surgical instrumentation (guides and implants) can come into play. Key to all state of the art developments in computer assisted surgery is the engineering on anatomy, enabled by multifunctional softwares and 3D printing technologies. Biomechanical modeling allows for patient-specific outcome prediction after surgical interventions and should become a routine practice in patient treatment. Patient specific surgical instrumentation is able to assist in realising the plan with sub-millimeter precision. Finally, quantification of the uncertainties that are inherent to biomechanical modeling is an essential contribution to reliable patient-specific outcome prediction. Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) is a lifesaving therapy in patients with end stage renal disease. Little is known about why life expectancy for these patients is reduced in Europe and USA as compared to Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the interdialytic weight gain (fluid retention in relation to estimated body weight in %, IDWG) in relation to the dialysis length (hours). Methods: 20 hemodialysis patients performed besides their regular dialyses 1 hemodialysis/week within the frame of the study during a 3 week period. The baseline values and the change during HD of NT-pro-BNP (ProBNP) and Troponin T (TnT) at 180 minutes and pentraxin 3 (PTX) at 30 and 180min were compared with the change in IDWG divided by the hours the patient performed the HD as a marker of speed of ultrafiltration. The PROOF formula used was: [100 x Weight gain between dialysis (kg)]/[estimated body dry weight (kg) x time of HD session (hours)]. Spearmans correlation analysis was used to adjust for eventual outliers. Results: There was a correlation between extent of removal of the IDWG/hours of HD: 1) the baseline values of ProBNP (rho=0.54, p<0.001), TnT (rho=0.37, p=0.004), PTX (rho=0.26, p=0.043) and 2) the change during HD at 30 min of PTX (rho=0.27, p=0.038) and at 180 minutes of ProBNP (rho=0.68, p<0.001) and TnT (rho=0.40, p=0.002). 3) a PROOF breakpoint < 0.63 caused less release of ProBNP (p<0.001). Discussion: The increase in weight between dialyses should be related to the body weight. A larger IDWG gives worse conditions. An increased speed of fluid in relation to body weight removal causes a higher release of cardiac markers indicating a strain and damage to the heart by each HD in contrast to what would be expected. Patients should be advised to limit fluid intake in relation to their body weight and adjust the HD length. Objectives: Fish roe is a highly nutritional product with diverse beneficial effects for the human health. This work used sardine (Sardina pilchardus) roe to produce novel delivery systems presenting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Methyl-tert-butyl ether extraction method was used to obtain lipid- and water-soluble compound rich phases. The fatty acids profile was analyzed by GC/MS. The identification of the hydrophilic compounds was performed by LC-HRMS. Lipids were used to produce large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs). The hydration of the lipid film was performed with PBS or sardine roe-derived aqueous phase. LUVs were characterized by their size, surface potential and morphology. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated using L929 cells. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated against different radicals, and their anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in the presence of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Results: GC/MS analyses demonstrated the presence of several fatty acids, such as omega 3 fatty acids. LC-HRMS analyses revealed the presence of numerous bioactive compounds (e.g. essential amino acids and gadusol). LUVs prepared with the aqueous phase presented a higher heterogeneity in terms of size than when they were prepared with buffer. Both LUVs formulations have a negative surface charge and a spherical shape. The extracts presented antioxidant activity against peroxyl, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals. Biological assays indicated that the extracts are cytocompatible for the lowest tested concentrations and that they can inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which reveals their anti-inflammatory effect. Discussion: Our sardine roe-derived delivery systems and compounds have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and thus they may be considered as a valid alternative for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Objectives: Engineered skeletal muscle tissues in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms that resemble the muscles complex native structure and organization can be used as in vitro models to study muscle physiology and metabolism. This project allows us to develop a new platform to model muscle diseases (such as myotonic dystrophy 1) in vitro in order to study its response to candidate therapeutics and to better understand disease mechanisms of pathogenesis. To this end, we monitor the secretion of disease-associated biomarker proteins and metabolites. Methods: Here, we present 3D skeletal muscle constructs, fabricated by encapsulating C2C12 cells and patient-derived transdifferentiated skin fibroblasts in a photocrosslinkable Gelatin Methacrylate and Carbolymethylcellulose Methacrylate (GelMA:CMCMA) hydrogel and cryogel scaffold. These scaffolds present a microgrooved topography that promotes cell alignment and differentiation. Electrical stimulation (ES) was then applied to the engineered tissues during cell culture to induce spontaneous contraction and maturation of the sarcomeres. Cell alignment differentiation, and the effect of ES were assessed by calculating the orientation angle and fusion index of immunostained myotubes expressing Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). Results: We have obtained a new platform to study the evolution of congenital muscle diseases, specifically myotonic dystrophy 1 and evaluate the functional tissues by metabolic and gene expression analysis. Monitor the secretion of biomarkers proteins, metabolites, and the glycolysis pathway of muscle tissues for different drug candidates. Discussion: This platform has been tested with different drugs assays and represent a step toward the goal of producing in vitro drug testing systems for medical and pharmaceutical industry applications. Finally, such \"muscle tissue-on-a-chip\" devices can be fabricated using patient's own cells as a major step toward personalized medicine. Objectives: The aim of this work is the creation and research of properties of tissue-engineering structures by the method of laser structuring a nanocarbon framework in bioorganic matrices. Methods: For the formation of the framework fibers from single-walled carbon nanotubes were used. Aqueous dispersions of nanocarbon fibers and proteins of albumin, collagen and amino sugar of chitosan were used as the initial medium for printing tissue-engineering structures. Printing of structures was carried out using the laser device generating pulsed laser radiation. The radiation wavelength was 1064 nm (100 ns pulse duration, 100 kHz frequency). Laser radiation using the scanner system of the device was moved on the dispersion layer. A computer model regulated the trajectory of the movement of radiation. Results: We have demonstrated the effect of welding nanocarbon fibers into a framework under the action of laser irradiation. The functionalization of nanocarbon fibers by protein and amino sugar molecules were proven. It was found the diameter of nanocarbon fibers was increased by several tens of nanometers due to their wrapping with a bio-organic matrix. Tissue-engineering structures had a meshy frame. The mesh size was 100x100 mu m. The electrical conductivity of the structures increased several times and amounted to 1 S/m with laser irradiation. The hardness of tissue-engineering structures was 150-370 MPa. The cytological compatibility of tissue-engineering structures with fibroblast cells and endothelial cells was tested. The density of proliferating cells on tissue-engineering structures was 33% more compared to the control type. In vivo investigations indicated the rate of biodegradation of tissue-engineering structures when implanted in laboratory animals for 60-90 days. Discussion: The investigated structures are promising for use in medical practice. Such structures can act as cardiac tissue-engineering implants since they have physicomechanical and biological properties similar to the parameters of cardiac tissue. Objectives: A major part of developing rotary blood pumps requires the optimization of hemolytic properties of the entire pump. The aim of this project was to compare blood flow simulation in the first and second generations of the ventricular assist device Sputnik and to evaluate its effect. Methods: Studies of the flow field were conducted with commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0, which uses a finite-volume approach. Scalar shear stresses were calculated for both pumps. The pumps were compared in terms of volumes subjected to certain viscous shear stress thresholds, below which no trauma was assumed (von Willebrand factor cleavage: 9 Pa, platelet activation: 50 Pa, and hemolysis: 150 Pa), associated residence times and recirculation zones. Results: Volume fractions of shear stress above 9 Pa, 50 Pa, 150 Pa were received: Sputnik-1 had 7.69 ml, 2,58ml, 0.74 ml, Sputnik-2 - 3.41 ml, 1.07 ml, 0.22 ml. The sum of the cell residence times at these shear stresses is 0.5095 s for the Sputnik-1 and 0.2019 s for the Sputnik-2. The volumes of recirculation zones were obtained, the value is 4.36 ml for the Sputnik-1 and 1.72 ml for the Sputnik-2. Discussion: The second generation of the VAD Sputnik have better flow characteristics than first. In the operating point, the volume fraction of the shear stresses is less, the residence time is less and the volume of recirculation zones is less. Objectives: End-stage renal disease is increasing dramatically in the western world and represents a major challenge for health care. Due to organ shortage transplantation can help only a few patients who otherwise require lifelong hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is an essential point and carries a high morbidity mainly due to occlusion of arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) and/or grafts (AVG). Therefore, alternative graft material has to be considered such as tissue engineered vascular grafts for access in hemodialysis. Methods: Besides patient characteristics and technical issues of surgical procedures the choice of the vascular graft is essential. Despite optimization over the last years, the clinical results are still sub-optimal due to early thrombosis and late intimal hyperplasia of the non-degradable synthetic vascular grafts such as Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or, polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Results: New material developments and tissue engineering techniques have shown good pre-clinical and initial clinical results for AVG implantation in hemodialysis patients. These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable, synthetic scaffolds to biological (mandril-induced) or decellularized grafts as well as self-assembly technologies. Discussion: This symposium will review the clinical need and especially address new developments of vascular grafts based on tissue engineering. Modern heart failure therapy makes use of left ventricular assist devices for severe cases as well as other active implants. While these devices have come far from their beginnings with improved hemocompatibility, smaller size and less invasive implantation techniques, their advancement takes close cooperation of engineers and clinicians to face the challenges of further advancements. It is vital to ensure interdisciplinary communication and exchange to define the future of Mechanical Circulatory Support. On the engineering side, greater biocompatibility, patient-specificity and options for smart devices and telemedicine offer great potential. These developments go hand in hand with improved surgical technique and clinical expertise. This cooperation will allow us to work towards reduced mortality, less adverse clinical events and ultimately improved quality of life for the cardiac assist device patient of the future. Objectives: To elucidate the role of the solvent and pH in the conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) and its binding to fatty acids. Albumin is a key biomolecule, found in most fluids of the body. HSA functions as depot and carrier for many compounds like fatty acids and affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Importantly, HSA acts as a toxic waste handler, displays pseudo enzymatic properties and it is a valuable biomarker in many diseases. Structurally, HSA is a very soluble, extremely robust and usually monomeric protein, which features three alpha-helical homologous domains that fold into a characteristic heart shape. Despite its importance, the reversible pH-dependent conformational transitions of HSA in solution are not yet fully understood. Methods: To compute the stability differences between the different conformers of HSA, we combine molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with free energy calculations. We determine the conformational free-energy change between conformers of HSA obtained upon introducing perturbations in the surroundings (pH, solvent mixtures) and its physiologically native state. Extended constant-pH MDs followed by Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations allow us modelling these systems at different pH values. We perform free energy perturbation calculations to characterize the binding sites of fatty acids to HSA under different conditions. Results and Discussion: We elucidate, at the molecular level, the effects of the solvent and pH on the conformational transitions and functionality of HSA. Our work allows establishing ways to modulate such transitions by tuning key biomolecular interactions, with implications for biomedical research. Objectives: The metal ions can affect differentiation of stem cells, which makes them interesting for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative in medicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is based on the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to form polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM). Multilayer systems combined with metal ions of different concentration might be promising for making coatings on implants and scaffolds to regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage, and others. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the concentration of metal ions on the physical properties of Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM), and evaluate the effect of metal ions on stem cell adhesion. Methods: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) prepared by layer-by-layer technique made of polysaccharides hyaluronan (HA) as polyanion and chitosan (Chi) as polycation were additionally cross-linked by metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+). to modulate physical properties and bioactivity of multilayers to control adhesion and function of mesenchymal murine C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts. Characterization of multilayer formation and surface properties was performed by different analytical methods. Results: Changes of wetting, thickness and mechanical properties of multilayers depending on concentration and type of metal ion. Most interesting, however, was the finding that metal ions like Fe3+ promoted adhesion and spreading of C3H10T1/2 cell greatly on the less adhesive HA/Chi multilayer system Discussion: Multilayer systems combined with metal ions can be used to regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage and others Objectives: The aim of the study is to analyse and modify the gas transfer properties of a novel PMP fiber blood gas exchanger with a cylindrical shaped blood flow channel by improving the sweep gas flow profile through the fiber bundle while considering the fiber length in blood contact. Methods: A test set-up has been developed to visualize the gas flow through the fiber bundle by means of steam. In an in-vitro setting with porcine blood the gas transfer rate has been measured subsequently. The cylindrical blood flow geometry and the fact that the fibers are stacked with an offset of 90 degrees onto each other results in fibers with various effective lengths. For the study, various prototypes of gas inlets with different inlet geometries have been designed, manufactured and evaluated regarding their gas transfer rates. Results: The different designs resulted in the aimed flow profiles during the flow visualization. Selected prototypes have been tested with blood and the gas transfer rates have been determined. However, the modified designs with improved gas flow properties do not significantly impact the gas transfer rates measured with blood. Discussion: Two possible explanations can be derived from the results which may be tested in the course of further studies. Firstly, it is possible that the current gas inlet is already sufficiently adapted to the cylindrical blood flow geometry and fibers of different effective length. Secondly, it could be considered that side parameters such as the diffusive transfer of water vapour from the blood side to the gas side have a superseding influence on the gas flow profile. In conclusion, the gas transfer rates cannot be significantly increased by manipulating the gas flow profile through the fiber bundle. Nevertheless, the blood gas exchanger achieves already comparable transfer rates to products on the market but has reduced PMP membrane surface. Objectives: Throughout the history of medical devices, highly invasive systems underwent a series of generations prior a successful establishment as a widely accepted therapy. The only available THA today (SynCardia TAH) is successfully saving lives but comes with a significant restriction of the quality of life (QoL) and a stigmatization of the patients. According to surgeons this is an important factor contributing to the low number of implantations today. Methods: Next generation devices using an implanted drive promise a new level of QoL and are currently developed by several institutions worldwide. Reasons for the long time to market of the next TAH generation (>15 years) might be found in the enormous challenges of technological aspects together with a difficult marked situation from an investors point of view. However, a higher QoL and an increasing trust in the reliability of the next TAH generations will inherently lead to a higher number of implantations, and further the acceptance of these devices towards an established therapy option. Results: The approach of the ReinHeart TAH is to adopt the well-proven hydraulic features of the SynCardia TAH while improving its current limitations. The ReinHeart TAH features a passive filling during diastole, a principal that is also successfully applied by the SynCardia TAH. The simple and robust linear driving mechanism allows for a compact design, achieving fit in the vast majority of patients. Beyond that, the drive principle makes additional sensors unnecessary. The compact, smart and usability-driven design of the external components will lead to a broad acceptance by the patients. Discussion: The unique features of the ReinHeart TAH elevate TAH-therapy to the next evolutionary step with regards to robust long-term application, size, ease of use and quality of life. Objectives: Circulating endothelial cells can be used to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, their concentration in the blood is very low (<100 per ml). A large volume of blood is needed, which should not be drawn from the patient. Instead a probe is inserted into the bloodstream of the patient to isolate as many cells as possible. The geometry of the cell probe is one of the key factors affecting cell deposition because its shape influences the flow conditions along the cell probe. The aim of this combined in vitro and in silico study is to find out the optimal flow conditions for cell deposition aiming to develop in future novel optimal cell probe shape. Methods: In vitro experiments in a closed loop with endothelial cells from HUVEC cell line were carried out and the cell deposition as a function of the probe shape (4 probe types) and five different flow rates were investigated. The knowledge of the flow conditions at the cell probe was obtained by flow simulations by using CFD software STAR CCM+. By combining the experimental and simulation data with an iterative procedure, wall shear stresses, which seems to promote cell deposition, can be identified. Results: It could be shown that the geometry of the cell probe has a much greater influence on cell deposition than the flow rates in the blood vessel. Wall shear stress around 0.4 Pa seems to be responsible for the optimal deposition of endothelial cells. However, this flow condition does not correlate with all flow rate experiments. Discussion: The results of the combined in vitro - in silico study on deposition of endothelial cells on the existing cell probe design are promising. However, the used in vitro set up does not allow to extract maximal information from each test and should be redesigned. Objectives: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) consists of the pump, driveline and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure. According to the recent research only 13% of failures were due to the pump itself, while over 60% were due to batteries, controllers and peripheral cables. Taking into account usability factors we present a novel control unit for the rotary blood pumps aimed to decrease LVAD malfunction. Methods: The pump motor windings are leaded out by doubled wires (six total) via driveline to the extracorporeal splitter where the driveline is divided by two ways. Each way consists of three pump motor phase signals and three current sense signals from the other way. The two identical control units with integrated rechargeable batteries are connected to each way of the splitter simultaneously. This symmetrical peripherals architecture allows each control unit to drive the pump (in the active mode) or sense the parameters from the parallel way (in the passive mode). The control is based on the field oriented control method that allows the passive unit to continuously monitor the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field vector in the pump, which is created by the active unit and, upon loss of control, immediately begins to generate control signals with the necessary amplitude and phase. In case of mismatch of the parameters in any control units, alarms are to occur. Results: Novel Sputnik LVAD was developed according to the described philosophy. This LVAD system has a backup feature which covers almost all peripherals including driveline, control system and battery. In case of the single fault condition in the peripherals the system continues to drive the pump with pause in the control less than 4 ms. Discussion: Developed peripherals integrated in the LVAD allow reducing the risk of the device malfunction and improving usability. Objectives: Polysaccharides belong to the most abundant biomaterials on earth. They form structural elements of plant and animal tissues, but many of them have also important regulatory functions towards cells, tissues and organs. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and other carboxylated and sulfated polysaccharides possess a bioactivity that is due to their high affinity to a plethora of proteins forming insoluble and soluble components of cell environments, but also direct interaction with cell receptors. Methods: Making surface coatings for implants from natural or semisynthetic GAG that guide cell behavior requires different strategies of covalent or physical attachment. Simple covalent binding mechanisms can be based on oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups of monosaccharide subunits or introduction of reactive side groups like thiols that permit direct coupling to surfaces. Results: Physical can exploit the inherent charge of these molecules that permits formation of multilayers kept together by ion pairing, but also intrinsic cross-linking of activated GAG. Both mechanism can be also used to form 3D structures as biocompatible in situ gelling hydrogels that permit embedding of growth factors and cells. Discussion: These 2D and 3D systems are instructive controlling cell spreading, growth and differentiation, which will be shown with examples on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem and other cells. Objectives: A successful creation and adequate maturation of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) provides efficient treatment and long term patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the predictors for primary failure of AVF, such as gender, age, AVF site of creation, and primary renal disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4/5. Methods: The medical records of 178 created arteriovenous fistulae in patients with CKD stage 4/5, in a single center for the year 2018, were retrospectively studied. Primary failure of AVF was defined as thrombosis or inability for cannulation of the fistula within 3 months of creation. Early thrombosis of AVF was defined as an immediate failure due to thrombosis of the fistula within 24 hours of creation. Adequate maturation of AVF was defined as successful cannulation of AVF for efficient HD. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.75 +/- 14.65 years, and 65.16% (116/178) were men. Adequate maturation of fistulae was achieved in 83.71% (149/178). Primary failure of AVF occurred in 16.29% (29/178) of the created fistulae, while 10.11% (18/178) had early thrombosis. Distal AVF (radio-cephalic) was the dominant site with 38.76% (69/178) of the created fistulae, followed by middle-arm AVF (radio-cephalic) site in 32.02% (57/178) and proximal AVF (brachio-basilic) site in 29.22% (52/178) of the created fistulae. The distal fistulae were significantly more frequently created in male patients (51 vs 18; p=0,015). The female patients were significantly older than the male patients (63.27 vs 57.86 years; p=0,018). The patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older than the non-DM patients (63.65 vs 58.05 years; p=0,018). Discussion: Hospital strategy for creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis is an \"Arteriovenous fistula first\". The female gender was more frequently associated with primary failure of AVF, while age, AVF creation site, and primary renal disease were not. Objectives: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer with trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) demonstrating biocompatibility and piezoelectric property are among the most promising biomaterials for nerve regeneration. Their blends with polydiphenylene phthalide (PDP) can improve nerve tissue regeneration due to combined electrical switching effect of PDP. Methods: Electrospinning and film casting were used to produce porous electrospun fibre mats and thin films, respectively. SEM, DSC, RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as piezoelectric measurements were performed to analyse morphology and physical-chemical properties of initial and final materials. A special measuring cell was designed to conduct dielectric spectroscopy measurements on samples with both deposited and pressed contacts. Results: Electrospun PVDF-TrFE and PVDF-TrFE+PDP fibre mats and casted PVDF-TrFE, PVDF, PVDF-TrFE+PDP film samples were produced. The range of fibre diameter of 0.5-1.2 mu m was obtained from SEM images. RAMAN (500-3500 cm(-1)) and FTIR (600-2000 cm(-1)) spectra were obtained for initial and final materials. The dependence of the samples capacity on the uniaxial pressure was measured. The frequency dependence of the capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle tg(delta) at a constant uniaxial pressure has also been analysed. Discussion: RAMAN spectrum of PDP+PVDF-TrFE fibre mats contains peaks from PDP and PVDF-TrFE, indicating that electrospinning method is suitable to produce PDP-containing PVDF-TrFE materials. Results of dielectric measurements showed that the presence of TrFE in co-polymer significantly reduces the value of the samples' capacitance. The capacitance of fibrous samples is much lower than that of films due to high porosity of fibre mats (>90%). TrFE-containing samples demonstrate high dielectric losses at low frequencies. The combined analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric properties is ongoing. Objectives: The objective of this study is the development of a magnetic levitation system of a new type of blood pump. A fully magnetically levitated plate is oscillating in a trapezoidal shaped pump housing to create a relatively blood gentle flow. The oscillating movement of the plate is realized with a combination of a driven harmonic oscillator and a 1-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation system. Methods: Multiple design concepts utilizing different electromagnetic principles were 3D modelled with Solid Works and imported into Ansys Mawell 3D to execute electromagnetic FEM simulations. Based on the results, the most suitable concept was selected by means of electromagnetic performance, stability, use of space and general feasibility. A PID-controller was implemented using Matlab/Simulink. The feasibility and stability of the concept was tested on a full-scale prototype. Results: The prototype demonstrates the feasibility and stability of the concept. The stabilization of the plate can be realized with an electric current that is about 7 times lower than bearable for the electromagnetic coils of the first prototype, allowing further miniaturization of future prototypes. Discussion: Though the general feasibility of the concept could be demonstrated, tests of the pumping performances are still pending to evaluate the suitability of the pump as an implantable blood pump. Objectives: Long term survival rate after the resection for the esophageal carcinoma has not been satisfactory. One of the most important topics in the area of the esophageal cancer is the reconstruction of the esophageal tract. If the artificial esophagus can be constructed, this technology will be beneficial for patients with esophageal cancer in the advanced stage. Methods: In the previous reports, artificial esophagus with shape memory (SMA) alloy actuator had been reported. However, total occlusion of the esophageal tract had been difficult. In this study, Origami engineering technology had been used for the peristaltic motion. Triangle shape of the Origami structure had been designed in this study for the total occlusion of the esophageal tracts to prevent the gastroesophageal reflux. The corner of the triangle had been pulled by SMA actuators following the diagonal lines for the folding power. Results: In the design concept of this artificial esophagus, the artificial esophageal tracts will be sutured to the human's esophagus. In this stage, the artificial esophageal tracts were consisted by the artificial vessel's material, and in the next stage regenerative esophagus will be the candidates. Esophageal tracts will be covered with triangle shape tracts with SMA actuator to embody the peristalsis. In the results in this study, total occlusion of the artificial esophageal tracts had been embodied by the use of the Origami structure. Through the arrangement of the triangle shape origami structures, co-driving will be embodied for the peristalsis function. Discussion: Until now, there had been no success in achieving peristalsis motion of the artificial esophagus. For the application of the human esophageal tracts, more study is necessary. This study was the first step for the application of the new artificial esophagus in the world for the achievement of the totally occluded peristalsis. Objectives: The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived grafts represents an alternative treatment option for post-myocardial infarction patients. So far, myocardial tissue engineering mainly focused on the generation of ventricular-like tissues providing sufficient contractile function. Atrial- and pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes (CMs) are hypothesized to have a negative effect on tissue function, as they could lead to a lower force development and to arrhythmias after transplantation, respectively. Therefore, we aim to characterize subtype composition in the differentiated CM cultures, as well as in generated tissues thereof and analyze tissue functionality. Methods: The hiPSC-CMs are then mixed with human fibroblasts and a matrix to generate bioartifical cardiac tissues (BCTs) using our established bioreactor technology. In order to assess the ratio of individual iPSC-derived CM subtypes, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with antibodies targeting subtype-specific markers (MLC2v, COUPTF-2, and MLC2a) were performed. Results: First results revealed a high percentage (80-90%) of MLC2v positive cells in differentiated CM populations. The remaining cells stained positive for atrial markers (COUPTF-2, MLC2a). Functional measurements mainly focused on BCT contractility and showed forces similar to the native myocardium (6.5 mN/mm2). In addition, we observed that a higher proportion of ventricular-like CMs leads to higher contractile BCT function. Discussion: Taken together, these molecular and functional results reveal that our differentiation protocol led to the formation of mainly ventricular-like CMs and that BCTs generated thereof show typical characteristics of myocardial tissues. For future ventricular-like tissue replacement therapy, we aim to perform a risk assessment for \"contaminating\" cardiac cell types with respect to both BCT function and arrhythmias. Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97 (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or C0(2)-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard with three identical pumps (Deltastream (R) DP3, Medos AG), two with the novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or C0(2)-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n = 6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and reliable hemolysis test results. Objectives: To characterize the biological background of prothrombotic platelet function in the setting of durable Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and to evaluate influence of different antithrombotic regimens dictated by specific clinical needs. Methods: Platelet thrombin generation was quantified in 75 LVAD patients implanted with the HeartMate II (n=10, 13%), HeartMate 3 (n=27, 36%), or HeartWare HVAD (n=38, 51%) using the Platelet Activity State (PAS) Assay and the Thrombin Generation Test (TGT). Data was compared in patients managed with i) oral anticoagulation plus aspirin (n=46, 61%) or ii) anticoagulation alone (n=29, 39%) due to significant bleeding risk. Coagulation parameters (platelet count, International Normalized Ratio [INR], activated Partial Thromboplastin Time [aPTT], Fibrinogen and D-Dimers levels) and hemolysis index (lactate dehydrogenase levels, LDH) were also recorded to comprehensively characterize hemostatic profiles and actual prothrombotic risk in the two groups. Results: The PAS assay revealed low-intensity increase in platelet prothrombinase activity in patients without aspirin (1.13-fold higher; p=0.04). Similarly, the TGT revealed moderate higher platelet reactivity in patients not on aspirin, consistent with reduction of lag time (0.87-fold lower; p<0.001), increase in peak of thrombin generation (1.5-fold higher; p=0.002) and thrombin generation rate (2-fold higher; p=0.01), but comparable endogenous thrombin potential (p>0.05). Coagulation parameters and LDH levels were not different in these two groups (p>0.05). Discussion: In patients with a durable MCS, aspirin minimally modulates the biochemical pathway of platelet thrombin generation. Re-evaluation of antithrombotic management criteria in selected patients stratified according to bleeding risk might significantly reduce LVAD hemcompatibility-related adverse events. Objectives: To determine the value of post-reperfusion kidney biopsyin predicting renal function and the incidence rate of DGF in deceased donor renal transplant recipients within 1 year after the surgery. Methods: We retrospectively included 461 patients who accepted the donation after the death of citizen at our center. According to the Remuzzi criteria, we compared the pathological biopsy and graft outcome between right and left donor kidneys from the same donor.Remuzzi score pound 3 was divided into low group, 4-6 middle group, > 6 high group. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and renal function within 1 year after surgery was observed. A multivariate analysis was conducted on the risk factors of kidney function and DGF incidence. Results: Of the 461 recipients,458 recipients have good graft function and 3 grafts failed. The reperfusion kidney biopsy, the incidence of graft DGF and renal function at each time point after transplantation between the left and right kidneys from the same donor were same (p>0.05). 88.1% was in low group, 10.4% in middle group, and 1.5% in high group. The incidence of DGF and the eGFR in different time points after transplantation were different (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that last creatinine before acquisition and Remuzzi score were independent predictors of DGF after transplantation (p<0.05). Vascular scores were independent risk factors affecting renal function at 1 year after transplantation(p<0.05) Discussion: The reperfusion renal allograft biopsy can reflect the donor's baseline data and predict early renal function after transplantation. Renal vascular disease may be an independent predictor of poor prognosis of the graft. The ongoing development of modern manufacturing processes, as well as the automation and cross-linking of production facilities opens up new freedoms for the individualized manufacturing of medical devices. The patient-specific design of these highly loaded devices is associated with a high degree of experience on the part of the designer. The assessment of the safety and performance of these \" lot size 1 products\" cannot be carried out economically by mechanical testing. This results in a verification gap in the product life cycle of patient-specific medical devices. A verification of the design and thus the evaluation of the function and safety of the products can only be carried out economically with the help of automated numerical simulations. A software to perform virtual strength assessment of custom implants was developed. The lecture shows how the verification process of patient-individual designs with numerical methods, can contribute to the increase of patient safety. In addition, the integration and documentation of numerical simulations within the product life cycle will be presented using industrial examples. Objectives: One of the most pressing issues of regenerative medicine is the fabrication of constructs with defined parameters in order to create conditions for proper cell adhesion and proliferation that will be close to native tissue conditions. An application utilizing the electrospinning method may potentially solve this problem. The main goal of this study was to fabricate electrospun scaffolds based on silk fibroin and to characterize their properties. Methods: Silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained by electrospinning method. There were two types of scaffolds: 1) silk fibroin scaffolds, 2) silk fibroin scaffolds with addition of 30 per cent of gelatin by mass. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and scanning probe nanotomography. Cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated in mice fibroblasts 3T3 model. The regenerative potential of scaffolds was estimated in a model of Wistar rat full-thickness skin wound regeneration. Results: The electrospun scaffolds have fibrous porous structure with an average fiber thickness 300-600 nm. Both types of scaffolds are biocompatible in vitro. Presence of gelatin in scaffold composition improves cell proliferation. Scaffolds promote skin wound regeneration and restore native skin structure. Histological analysis did not evolve inflammatory process. Discussion: Electrospinning is a promising method to obtain fibrous biomimetic constructs with defined properties. The biocompatibility of produced constructs was shown in vitro and in vivo. Both types of scaffolds have a significant regenerative potential and are prospects for different fields of regenerative medicine. Objectives: Biodegradable PCL-based electrospun scaffolds are often used in TE. However, such scaffolds lack biocompatibility, wettability and chemical accessibility for tendon replacement applications. Here, we propose a new method to overcome those shortcomings by using PCL:Chitosan-graft-PCL (PCL:CS-g-PCL) blends instead of post-process coatings. Methods: Blended solutions of PCL (175 mg/ml in 2,2,2-TFE) and CS-g-PCL (1200 mg/ml in chloroform) were electrospun into scaffolds with CS-g-PCL from 0 to 90 wt% (10 ratios). SEM based measurements were carried out to investigate fiber diameter and morphology. Chitosan amino groups within the fibers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). DSC measurements were conducted to assess thermal properties and crystallinity. Subsequently, metabolic activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on the scaffolds, was determined over 7 days. Results: Blends with CS-g-PCL contents < 90 wt% led to fiber diameter of 1 +/- 0.35 mu m and to 2 +/- 0.38 mu m for 90 wt%. XPS measurements showed an enrichment of chitosan amino groups at the surface of the fibers. The enthalpy of fusion increased by up to 40 J/g for CS-g-PCL contents from 0 to 90 wt%, indicating a significant increase in crystallinity. hMSCs had maximum metabolic activity on samples with CS-g-PCL contents between 10 and 30 wt%. Discussion: Electrospinning of blended PCL:CS-g-PCL solutions resulted in higher crystallinity while preserving mechanical properties. Furthermore, increased wettability improved biocompatibility and chemical accessibility, which ultimately influenced the metabolic activity of the hMSCs positively. This promising novel approach will increase the biocompatibility of PCL-based scaffolds with simultaneous reduction in production complexity. Objectives: Biventricular assist device (BVAD) is reported to be used in 3-5% of continuous-flow VAD (cf-VAD). Our recent strategy is to stabilize INTERMACS profile 1 or unstable profile 2 patients by paracorporeal VAD, central ECMO or IABP before proceeding to cf-VAD. Patients with RV failure are also aggressively treated by PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist at the outpatient clinic after implant. We examined validity of this strategy by analyzing BVAD necessity and patient survival. All cf-VAD was used for bridge to transplantation. Average waiting time for heart transplantation is nearly 3.5 years in our country. Methods: 166 consecutive patients were implanted with cf-VAD. DCM was seen in 113, ICM in 14, dHCM in 12, post-myocarditis CM in 6, ARVC in 3, RCM in 3 and others in 15. 130 patients underwent primary cf-LVAD implantation. Pre-implant profiles of those patients were 2 in 62, 3 in 62 and 4 in 6. 36 patients were converted from another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Actuarial survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and comparisons were made using Log-rank method. Results: No patient required RVAD at the time of implantation nor late after implantation. Average support duration was 787 days, and 53 patients were on the support longer than 3 years. During follow-up 56 patients reached transplantation, 9 weaned from VAD due to functional recovery and 80 on-going support. 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 166 patients was 92.8%, 89.5% and 85.9%. There were no statistical differences between subgroups, such as sex, pre-implant profile, body size and primary/redo sternotomy. Discussion: We successfully implanted cf-LVAD and managed in the outpatient clinic without RVAD support in 166 consecutive patients, including those who were severely ill in the pre-implant stage. Our strategy for stabilizing profile 1 and unstable profile 2 patients by other types of MCS and aggressive use of PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist seemed to be safe and effective. Objectives: Recently, composite bionanomaterials containing biological materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been actively studied. CNTs may contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles and they can affect the properties of the composite bionanomaterial. To the study of this issue, we paid attention. The object of the study was a composite nanomaterial consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA - matrix) and single-walled CNT (SWCNT - filler). Methods: Aqueous dispersion in the composition of 20 wt.% BSA and 0.01 wt.%. SWCNTs were prepared using traditional nanotechnology methods (thorough mixing, ultrasonic homogenization, decanting, etc.). The optical density of dispersion was measured after a magnetic field gradient ( 1 T/m) was applied to it for 100 hours. The obtained values were compared with the optical dispersion density in the absence of a magnetic field. Recent samples were considered control. Results: It was found that under the action of a magnetic field, the optical density of the water dispersion of BSA/SWCNT in the region of 300 divided by 800 nm decreases by > 10% relative to control samples. Additionally, it was found that under the action of a magnetic field, the optical density of the aqueous dispersion of BSA/SWCNT decreases by > 10% relative to control samples. Discussion: The decrease in the optical dispersion density of BSA/SWCNT is caused by the deposition of nanotubes on the cell surface under the action of a magnetic field gradient. It is assumed that the single walled carbon nanotubes contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Estimates showed that in bionanomaterial at a level with concentrations > 0.0001 wt.% CNT nanotubes can be fixed with modern sensors of a weak magnetic field with a threshold sensitivity of <= 1 pT. It was concluded that changes in implants in the BSA/SWCNT composite bionanomaterials can be observed non-invasively with the help of weak magnetic field sensors (for example, SQUID or CMFS). Objectives: Recent developments in imaging technology have enabled cryobiologists to reveal some mechanisms employed by nature to cope with freezing stress. The systematic study of these mechanisms may prove useful for developing ultimately novel and efficient cryopreservation protocols. In this work, we examine the potential advantages of using infrared video thermography (IVT) for monitoring latent heat release and freeze-thaw events in 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds used as a model system. In this context, we present ongoing results on the identification of warm ice-nucleating agents (INA) from Hippophae rhamnoides with potential use in cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs). Methods: The scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying of mineralized collagen suspensions and characterized by Raman microscopy, X-ray microcomputed tomography and differential scanning calorimetry. Visualization of freezing/thawing events in scaffolds frozen with and without cryoprotective solutions based on leaf homogenate from Hippophae rhamnoides was performed using the thermography-based platform developed at the University of Thessaly. Results: Scaffolds presented 3D porous architecture and characteristic RAMAN peaks of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Presence of HAP decreased the specific heat capacity of collagen scaffolds. The probability of ice nucleation was higher in cryoptotective solutions with scaffolds than in solutions without. The ice nucleation temperature within scaffolds using INA was determined to be around -1.5 degrees C. Discussion: IVT proved to be a very effective approach for visualizing latent heat release and freeze-thaw events within scaffolds frozen in cell culture plates. INA from Hippophae rhamnoides may potentially be used for prevention of supercoiling in cryopreservation. The results obtained could serve as a basis for further development of efficient cryopreservation protocols for 3D TECs. Objectives: In the development process of heart assist devices, numerical simulations become more and more essential. The variety of applications comprises different types of cannulas or flow geometries of ventricular assist devices (VADs). The analysis of the flow field inside VADs by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely useful. Numerical parameter studies allow the treatment of several device related problems in conjunction with a well-balanced cost-benefit ratio. Methods: Results obtained from properly performed CFD calculations permit the determination of flow induced blood damage of new flow designs in VADs and enable the prediction of the risk of harmful hemolysis for the patient. The literature provides different models for blood cell damages. In application, a proper definition of acceptable thresholds is required, in order to optimize blood guiding geometries as rotor blades or diffusor shapes in VADs. Another application of CFD can be found in the field of flow path optimization of new cannula designs. Corresponding results can lead to various design changes and can significantly contribute to a comprehensive risk analysis for regulatory assessment. Results: Based on the numerical results, geometrical design iterations can considerably improve the flow design of blood pumps and cannulas. Thoroughly optimized designs exert reduced shear stresses to the cells and create less damage to the patient's blood. Furthermore, CFD studies can provide valuable information in the process of risk analysis during the regulatory assessment of heart assist devices and support the interpretation of experimental in-vitro investigations. Discussion: Although numerical simulations represent a commonly used tool during research and development in the field of heart assist devices, the introduction of strict requirements and well-defined guidelines would considerably simplify the implementation of numerical studies for regulatory approval and enhance the comparability of independently gained results. Objectives: Current standards in cryopreservation for biomedical technology are still based on slow freezing processes inducing crystallization within the sample. In preparation for this cryopreservation regime, cells and tissues are detached from growth surfaces and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Existing infrastructures like freezing devices, lab ware, and liquid nitrogen tanks for long-term storage, are designed for the handling of suspended cells and tissues and for stock keeping purposes, these procedures usually are efficient enough. Through the addition of cryoprotective agents, the sample can cope with the emerging damaging mechanism resulting from ice crystal formation. However, diagnostically and therapeutically relevant cell systems, e.g. human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or their derivates like neuronal cells, depend on cell-cell and cell-surface interactions mediated by cytoskeletal proteins. Their structures are disordered, either due to these preparatory dissociating steps or due to crystallization, resulting in loss of functionality or cell loss in general. Methods: A second cryopreservation regime, the vitrification, avoids crystallization within the sample and thus avoids the occurring damaging mechanisms (e.g. shear forces, osmotic shock). Thereby, the structure of cells and tissues is preserved, leading to viable and functional cells even in their adherent state (with cell-cell and cell-surface contacts) after thawing. However, vitrification requires a skilled handling and so far, the infrastructure has not been established to enable routine vitrification workflows for large cell numbers. Results and Discussion: Our work shows the potential and capacity of vitrification on different cell types (e.g. hiPSCs, dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrate that vitrification is superior to slow freezing regarding cell loss and functionality and holds the possibility to cryopreserve scalable and ready-to-use cell products for a broad range of biomedical research. Objectives: The aim of this work is to characterize the decellularized human chorion membrane (dHCM) and to study its suitability as a substrate to model biological barriers. Methods: HCMs were submitted to a chemical and physical decellularization process. The decellularization protocol was optimized by quantifying and analyzing the presence and distribution of cell nuclei and dsDNA by DAPI staining, PicoGreen and electrophoresis. The dHCM was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, Dot-Blot, SDS-PAGE, and GAGs and Collagen quantification. Moreover, dHCM's mechanical properties were assessed and biocompatibility tests (metabolic and proliferation assays) with an endothelial human cell line (EA.hy.926) were performed. Results: The decellularization process of the HCM was successful, since the presence of nuclei was not observed, the amount of dsDNA was around 10 ng/mg of dry tissue, and the DNA fragments had less than 200 bp. A compact membrane that preserved the HCM's reticular layer and basement membrane was obtained. SEM images revealed that dHCM is a substrate with two different surfaces: one composed by nanofibers and the other (in trophoblast layer's side) covered by a thin compact layer (basement membrane). In tissue sections it was possible to verify the presence of collagen type I and IV, fibronectin and laminin in both dHCM and native tissue. Corroborating these results higher molecular weight species were preserved in dHCM (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, dHCM's mechanical properties were determined: young's modulus of 5.9 MPa and ultimate tensile strength of 5.3 MPa. Differences in metabolic activity and cell proliferation were observed between both sides of the dHCM. Discussion: dHCM retained the main proteins of the extracellular matrix. Cell proliferation and viability were higher in the side of dHCM that preserved the basement membrane. dHCM's physical and mechanical properties make it a suitable substrate to mimic biological barriers. Objectives: Cryogels with improved non-fouling and cell adhesive surface properties were investigated as potential cell scaffold for BAL purpose. Cryogel monolith columns were used by other groups to fill the bioreactor chamber. However, device performance was not maintained for more than a few hours. Fluid dynamic measurements using a purpose-built mu PIV setup with video post-processing were conducted in order to extrapolate the effect of flow inside the cryogel matrix to improve cell viability and avoid blood cell activation. Starting from PIV results, a multi-layered bioreactor composed of spaced cryogel discs was developed to maximise blood/hepatocyte mass-exchange. This study aimed to investigate whether the multi-layered design results in improved performance compared to the column version in terms of hepatocytes viability and functionality. Methods: p(HEMA-co-MBA) cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique. Cryogels were then functionalised with alginate and RGD peptide and synthesised by solid phase method. Porous structure was analysed with SEM, confocal imaging and mu CT. Non-fouling properties were investigated by protein absorption studies. Cell viability was assessed by MTT/ATP activity and live/dead imaging. Hepatocyte functionality in bioreactors was investigated by quantification of albumin and urea production using ELISA and colorimetric assay, respectively, over time. Results: Synthesised cryogels possessed an open porosity with pore sizes of up to 100 mu m and an interconnected network of pores. Alginate helped preventing protein absorption from plasma. RGD peptide enhanced hepatocyte functionality. Cryogel perfused bioreactors maintained hepatocytes viability and functionality for up to 1 week. Discussion: Multi-layered bioreactor design showed a significantly higher production of albumin and urea compared to the column version, suggesting an improved mass exchange between medium and cells. Also cell colonization and proliferation through the device were improved. Objectives: Placental complex, including placental tissues, foetal membranes, and umbilical cord, is one of the most promising sources of a range of tissues and cells for clinical and experimental application in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Certain components of placental material are already applied in medicine since decades, while others undergo intensive research and pre-clinical trials. Since placenta is a temporary organ, it provides the unique opportunity to obtain large amounts of tissues, including autologous, without the adverse effects to the donor. Moreover, great potential of placental multipotent stromal cells is recognized in generation of tissue engineered multicellular constructs. At the same time, clinical use and research proceedings are significantly restricted due to imperfections in storage technologies. Application of low-temperature preservation methods is especially challenging for 3-D multicellular structures, such as organs, tissues, and tissue engineered constructs. Methods: Here we aim to analyze the variety of cryoinjuries in a range of placental tissues and tissue engineered multicellular placental constructs, as well as support the cellular viability after low temperature storage. A range of cell and tissue culture as well as tissue engineering methods, cryomicroscopic analysis, evaluation of phenotypic and metabolic characteristics have been applied in this study. Results: Results have shown that the mechanisms of damage caused by cryopreservation procedures depend on particular structure of the studied object, peculiarities of intercellular bonds, as well as interaction with cryoprotective agents. At the same time, developed protocols allowed us to efficiently isolate viable cells after thawing of the studied tissues. Discussion: Conclusions of this study may lead to progress in improvement of biobanking technologies for tissues and tissue engineered multicellular constructs. Extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, apheresis or blood oxygenation, are only possible when recurrent blood access is feasible. Both, artificial grafts, e.g. made of polyethylene-terephthalate (Dacron (R)) or a fistula are not ideal models for that purpose and are commonly considered to represent the Achilles` Heel of extracorporeal blood circuits. A stable, implantable biologic vascular graft would be an ideal solution for the benefit of patients and many bioengineers are working on this dream to come true. When considering such a vascular graft to be used clinically and as a product to be sold in the medical device market, a series of problems with regard to approval have to be solved and some fundamental questions be answered. Regarding approval, current EU regulations refer to either the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) from 2017 or to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation (ATMPs) from 2007. Under the premise \"Better safe than sorry!\" regulations, such as MDR and ATMP, represent a European law. A bioengineered vascular graft is taken as a \"combination product\", as it is commonly made of biological cells and a (possibly) biodegradable scaffold material. When implanted, it would represent a high-risk class III medical device under the MDR regulation and would require a CE-mark. The ATMP regulation, however, says that a combination product has to be approved following the \"principal mode of action\". For products containing viable cells or tissues, a specific approach has been taken by the EU. For these products it holds true that \"whatever the role of the medical device, the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action of these cells are considered to be the principal mode of action\". Under these premises, a combination product, such as a bioengineered vascular graft, is regulated under the ATMP rules, which renders approval rather complex. Consequences refer to the need of Phase I-III clinical trials including post-market surveillance Neuroengineering is a research area where engineering skills are used to solve basic and clinical problems in neuroscience. The aim of the presentation is to give an insight into neuroengineering applied in neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a method for reducing symptoms in movement disorders as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. A thin electrode is surgically implanted with stereotactic technique at a well-defined brain structure. Our research focus on support systems for improving the surgical implantation procedure, and to increase the understanding of the DBS mechanism. A method for performing patient-specific simulations of the electric field around a DBS lead and map the data to the anatomy has been developed. The goal is to create improvement and side-disorder maps for the most common symptoms and brain targets used in DBS. Optics is another core area we apply in neurosurgery. Several optical probe systems for intraoperative guidance have been developed. Forward-looking probes can act as \"vessel alarm\" by recording the tissue's microcirculation with laser Doppler flowmetry during creation of the brain trajectories in relation to stereotactic neurosurgery. In DBS this method has been evaluated in the clinical setting in more than 100 implantations. For brain tumor biopsies the method is presently introduced in combination with 5-ALA fluorescence measurements at the tumor border. 5-ALA induced fluorescence spectroscopy- and microscopy can also be used together in brain tumor surgery. Under the neurosurgical \"blue-light\" microscope, a hand-held probe supports the surgeon by enhancing malignant tissue. Another challenge is optical monitoring of cerebral microcirculation in the neuro-intensive care setting. A prerequisite for successful project outcome is a close collaboration between biomedical engineers and neurosurgeons. difference. Objectives: The main goal of this study was to synthesize polysaccharide-based hydrogel systems that favor bone regeneration. The hydrogel formation is driven by Schiff base crosslinking reaction between the amino functionalities of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMChi) and the aldehyde groups of the different oxidized polysaccharides resulting in an imine bond formation. Methods: Different amounts of NaIO4 were used in order to oxidize Alginate (ALG) and Hyaluronic acid (HA), forming reactive dialdehyde derivatives with different oxidation degrees. The amount of aldehyde groups was determined by: A) using Schiff's reagent and detected by a UV-Vis spectrometer (550nm) and B) acid base titration after reacting the aldehyde groups with Hydroxylammoniumchloride. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used for molecular weight determination of the different polysaccharides. Biocompatibility of the products was tested using Qblue (R) assay and CFDA staining. Results: Data obtained from both UV-VIS spectroscopy and titration show that the different polysaccharides have more aldehyde groups when high concentrations of NaIO4 were used and the reaction times were extended. The weight average molecular weights of all the products were lower after the oxidation step. Products with high oxidation degrees showed low biocompatibility. Discussion: ALG and HA with high oxidation degrees are required to prepare stable hydrogel systems and the dual utility of using CMChi and oxidized polysaccharides as both structural and bioactive component is promising for the formation of biocompatible hydrogel systems that can be used for bone tissue regeneration. Objectives: Xenotransplantation of transgenic porcine pancreatic islets offers a promising alternative source to circumvent current limitations posed by the scarcity of allogeneic donors. However, either immune rejection or oxygen supply in immune protected encapsulated islets remains a major concern. To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we have investigated the feasibility to generate tissue engineered SLA silenced islet cell clusters (ICC) from alpha-Gal knock out, CD46, CD55 and CD59 transgenic minipigs. Methods: Pancreatic islets single cell suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. The single cells were silenced for SLA class I and II by lentiviral vectors encoding for Nanoluciferase as reporter gene and for short hairpin RNAs targeting beta2-microglobulin (shb2m) or class II transactivator (shCIITA), respectively. SLA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR and protein levels by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses. Cell death was evaluated by Propidium Iodide staining. The effect of SLA class I silencing was evaluated in human T and NK cell cytotoxicity assays. SLA-silenced pancreatic beta-cells were then used to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors. Results: SLA class I silencing was designed to reach a level of up to 86% and class II by up to 64% on pancreatic islet cell monolayers. Silencing SLA expression did not affect cell viability and the insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype as indicated by Dithizone staining and levels of insulin production. Xenogeneic T-cell immune responses (p<0.05) as well as antibody-mediated cellular-dependent immune responses (p<0.01) were significantly decreased. Silencing SLA class I expression did not increase susceptibility to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In stirred bioreactors, tissue engineered islets showing the typical 3D-structure and morphology of ICC were assembled from SLA-silenced pancreatic cell suspensions to be used for transplantation in humanized mice as a first model. Discussion: These data shows the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICC from transgenic pigs after single cell engineering and post- transduction islet reassembling that might serve as a robust alternative to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation. Objectives: In patients with circulatory support, preload is a valuable clinical monitoring variable. While it is difficult to measure directly, it can be indirectly measured by PCWP or left atrial pressure (LAP). Typically, assessments of LAP require invasive methods. However, non-invasive estimation of LAP can be a useful tool for monitoring patients and adjusting pump speed to reduce the likelihood of hazardous events, such as ventricular suction and pulmonary congestion. This study presents an artificial neural network model estimating the LAP noninvasively across different patient conditions. Methods: LAP was estimated based on the HeartWare HVAD pump characteristics (current, flow and speed) derived from 186 experiments performed in a mock circulatory system with HVAD speed range from 1800 to 3600 rpm. The LAP estimation was evaluated by measuring the hemodynamic variables in response to a range of changes to the mock cardiovascular system, including changes in PVR, SVR and HR. A neural network was trained with 70% of the data (randomly chosen), and was validated and tested with the rest of data. The model performance was quantified by the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r2) and Bland-Altman plot between measured and estimated LAP in different scenarios. Results: The neural network model was able to estimate LAP accurately using data collected in-vitro for training, validation and test sets. The MSE for all data is 1.36 mmHg, and correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.91 and 0.94 for training, validation and test sets, respectively. The Bland-Altman plot showed that error has a bias of 0.28 mmHg with a reproducibility coefficient of 2.2 mmHg. Discussion: The developed model would be useful for a real-time estimation of preload noninvasively which can be employed to adjust pump speed in heart-failure patients without inserting a pulmonary catheter into the pulmonary artery. Implementation of the developed estimator would also create a new physiological control system that can work noninvasively. Objectives: Blood vessels are integral to the maintenance of all tissues. They deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste. Blood vessels not only contain endothelial cells (ECs) that are in direct contact with flowing blood cells and fluids but they may also have pericytes and smooth muscle cells on the outside that stabilize and regulate their size. Defects in EC and pericyte/smooth muscle cell interaction are often implicated in many pathological conditions. Patients with a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) suffer from heavy and recurrent nosebleeds, due to unstable blood vessels as a result of defective interaction between ECs and pericytes. Methods: Here we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a source of patient-specific cells, as they can be derived from all individuals, including children and patients with genetic disease and subsequently differentiated towards all cells of the body. Besides, we can now use hiPSCs to derive all the component of blood vessels in large numbers and use them to re-create blood vessels on a chip to model inflammation and disease. Results: HHT-hiPSC-ECs displayed no apparent functional differences using a set of standard two-dimensional (2D) assays. The ability of hiPSC-ECs to form a perfused microvascular network was next examined using three-dimensional (3D) cultures in microfluidic chips. Using these 3D vessels on a chip, we found that in contrast to 2D microvascular cultures, the ability to form 3D microvessels in microfluidic chips was strikingly compromised when HHT-hiPSC-ECs were used compared to isogenic control ECs. Discussion: This patient-based hiPSC model thus serves as the first proof of principle that vascular diseases could be modeled using patient-specific hiPSCs in 3D microfluidic chips and to identify new target cells and possible pathways for therapy. Objectives: This study was aimed at fabricating various layer-by-layer (LbL) systems using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with the capability to bind BMP-2 specifically in order to control osteogenic differentiation of cells by biocompatible release systems. Methods: Heparin, chondroitin sulfate and their oxidized forms as polyanions were combined with chitosan and collagen I as polycations to form various multilayer coatings on model materials with the advantage of the intrinsic cross-linking formed between oxidized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and polycations, improving multilayer stability and affecting the release of BMP-2. The myoblast cell line C2C12, which can differentiate into osteoblasts was seeded on 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 loaded multilayers. Cell viability, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation and BMP-2 release were investigated. Results: C2C12 cells cultured directly on the top of multilayers showed that particularly BMP-2 loaded multilayers made of oxidized GAGs promoted an osteogenic differentiation that was nearly comparable to the positive control, when 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 was added directly to the medium. Interestingly, the BMP-2 had synergistic effect on cell adhesion and spreading. BMP-2 in oxidized chondroitin sulfate multilayers was successfully loaded to the layers, sustainably released over time and affected cell differentiation more than the soluble BMP-2. Discussion: The results show that oxidized GAGs forming intrinsically cross-linked multilayers are useful as reservoirs for sustained release of BMP-2 in which the intrinsic cross-linking affected BMP-2 release, improved multilayers stability due to the resulting stiff surface compared to the native ones, supported cell adhesion, proliferation and subsequent differentiation. This can pave the way for coating implants and scaffolds for repair and regeneration of bone fractures. Objectives: Functional myocardial recovery during support with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is highly desirable but only observed in approx. 1% of all patients. Previously, the more frequently implanted pulsatile blood pumps (PBPs) showed higher recovery rates than the currently used rotary blood pumps (RBPs). The aim of this study was to comparatively assess the capability of PBPs and RPBs to unload the left ventricle and restore physiological cardiac energetics in isolated hearts. Methods: An RBP (Medtronic HVAD) and a heartbeat synchronized PBP (BerlinHeart Excor) were alternately connected to eight isolated porcine hearts. To modulate the mode of LVAD support, RBP rotational speed was set to different support levels and ejection delay of the PBP was phased from 0% to 90%. Pressures, flows, left ventricular volumes, and myocardial oxygen consumption were recorded and cardiac efficiency quantified by the ratio of external work (EW) over myocardial oxygen consumption. Results: With increasing RBP support, lower left atrial pressures (LAP) were found to coincide with a decreased cardiac efficiency (r=0.91 +/- 0.12) with a median [inter quartile range] slope of 0.28 [0.91] %/mmHg. In contrast, depending on the phase delay of ejection of a PBP, LAP and cardiac efficiency follow a sinusoidal course with the LAP minimum at 90% and efficiency maximum at 60%. Discussion: In RBP support, aggressive ventricular unloading was found to lead to lower cardiac efficiencies. On the other side, phasing of a PBP offers the possibility to restore cardiac efficiency and simultaneously unload the ventricle. These results may justify future studies linking optimized cardiac mechanics and efficiency to functional recovery and reverse myocardial remodeling with LVAD therapy. Objectives: We focused on the interventricular dyssynchrony caused by the shortened systole of left ventricle (LV) compared to right ventricle (RV) during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. The purpose of this study was to assess and quantify the mechanical interventricular dyssynchorny according to the support condition using conductance catheter. Methods: We studied five goats with normal heart condition. A centrifugal LVAD was implanted under general anesthesia. We inserted the conductance catheter into the LV and RV and obtained the pressure-volume relationship. We defined the dyssynchronous status by the sign (plus or minus) of the LV volume (LVV) change is opposite to that of RV volume (RVV). (i.e., (dLVV/dt)*(dRVV/dt)<0). Interventicular dyssynchrony (DYS) was quantified by calculating the percentage of time within the cardiac cycle. Bypass rate was set dividing the LVAD pump flow by the main pulmonary artery flow. We calculated the DYS under LVAD support with various bypass rate. Results: The mean DYS of normal heart, LVAD clamp, LVAD support with bypass rate of 50%, 75 % and 100% were 6.0 +/- 1.3, 8.6 +/- 2.6, 9.6 +/- 1.8, 15.5 +/- 5.6, and 24.6 +/- 8.6, respectively. Also, there was a higher linear negative correlation between LV stroke volume and DYS. Discussion: Interventricular dyssynchrony during LVAD support was assessed and quantified using conductance catheters. Dyssynchrony became significant when the LV was unloaded with high rotational speed under LVAD support. Assessment of influences for the right ventricular function and heart failure models will be studied in the further study. Objectives: (Bio)chemical modification of implants with drug delivery systems can support the body's natural healing capabilities by imitation of smooth tissue transitions along bone-tendon conjunctions. Modified interconnected 3D porous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could act as a scaffold material for these implants. Methods: Cocontinuous blends of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by batch blending in an internal mixer. Annealing and leaching of the blends with water yielded the porous PCL scaffolds, which were then modified with chitosan (CS) grafted PCL (CS-g-PCL) via dip coating. Nanoparticle systems containing CS and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were obtained via ionotropic gelation. These CS-TPP nanoparticles (CSNPs) can be attached to the modified scaffolds via a Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition approach involving alginate (ALG). Results: Interconnected 3D porous PCL scaffolds with different morphologies have been prepared. Modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate, alginate fluorescein amine (ALG-FA), CS-TPP and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled nanoparticles (CS-FITC-TPP) in a LbL approach was carried out. The blank scaffolds were analyzed in various ways, including via scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Modified versions of the scaffolds were analyzed accordingly and the fluorescently labeled species were investigated via confocal laser scanning microscopy. CSNPs were loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered on the modified scaffolds. Release of BSA from the scaffolds was investigated by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Discussion: Porous PCL scaffolds with different pore sizes and morphologies can be obtained via annealing and leaching of cocontinuous PCL/PEO blends. Surface modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate and CSNPs open up possibilities regarding graded implant fabrication. Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate in CKD patients is crucially important. Objectives: Heterogeneously structured electrospun composite scaffolds have performed well as ECM-mimetic tissue replacements in recent years. In light of this, we present an assessment of amnion derived multipotent stromal cell (aMSC) growth on hybrid polycaprolactone(PCL)-gelatin(G) scaffolds in terms of viability, infiltration depth and metabolic activity. Methods: Four scaffold types were electrospun (150 mu m thick) with different PCL:G ratios and fibre diameter distributions using vertical (V) and horizontal (H) orientations - PCL175V (175 mg/ml, homogenous), PCL125G50H (125:50 mg/ml, homogeneous), PCL125G50V (125:50 mg/ml, heterogeneous), PCL100G75V mg/ml (100:75 mg/ml, heterogeneous). A 7 day live/dead assay and a 15 day infiltration study (depths measured using confocal laser scanning microscope) with aMSCs from Callithrix jacchus were performed. Metabolic activity was measured by MTT assay (7 days). Additionally, gelatin loss during scaffold degradation (30 days) was measured by Raman spectroscopy. Results: In general, PCL-gelatin blends perform better than unblended PCL. PCL125G50V shows the deepest cell infiltration on all days (76.3 +/- 7.1 mu m by day 15). It is also the only sample that shows an increasing trend in metabolic activity from day 1 (0.0436 +/- 0.002) to day 7 (0.0996 +/- 0.009). Raman spectroscopy revealed a significant gelatin loss of 53.44 +/- 6.48 % in PCL100G75V while PCL125G50V showed no significant loss by day 15. Discussion: A combination of heterogeneous fiber morphology and composite polymer content in electrospun scaffolds positively affects cell growth and infiltration. Considerable gelatin swelling during degradation can physically inhibit infiltrating cells. Therefore, choosing the right ratio of PCL:gelatin when designing such scaffolds is key. A total artificial heart is used for orthotopic replacement of the native ventricles in cases of irreversible biventricular heart failure resulting either from chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or fulminant acute myocardial infraction. It is essential to find the right indication. There are several surgical options to perform a total artificial heart operation. To prevent therapy-failure it essential to set the right indication for implanting a total artificial heart. In general therapy with a TAH is feasible with good postoperative results. Setting the right clinical frame is crucial for the establishment of a therapy concept. Objectives: Although diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in many countries, data about its impact on patient-specific reaction to haemodialysis (HD) is scarce. Models that allow identifying and predicting patient-specific response to HD are in development and their improvement is encouraged by clinicians to obtain suitable decision support systems (DSS). Here, possible correlations between diabetes and alterations in the patient-specific parameters identified by a multi-pool, multi-solute model, developed in our laboratory, are investigated. Methods: Data acquired during the 'DialysIS' Interreg Project (141 patients, 4 centres, 1276 HD) have been used. For each patient, a set of specific parameters was identified: one modulates the permeability at the capillary wall (rho), the others account for altered transport of catabolites and electrolytes at the cellular wall (k(i)) and at the dialyser membrane (eta(i)), where '(i)' indicates different solutes. Patients have been classified as diabetic (D) or not (ND) and among Ds, as insulin-dependent (D_ID) or not (D_NID). Initial glucose concentrations and identified values of rho, ki, eta i in the different groups have been compared using proper statistical tests (p<0.01). Results: There were were 37 (26,4%) D patients and 16 of them were D_ID (43,2%). Initial plasma glucose concentration statistically differs both between D and ND and between D_ID and D_NID patients. Among the patient-specific parameters rho, and K-Na, K-Mg, K-Creatinine and K-Bicarbonate results were different between D and ND. The values of eta(Na), eta(Mg), eta(Ca), eta(Urea) and eta(Creatinine), instead, significantly differ between D_ID and D_NID. Discussion: Diabetes-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathies can justify the finding of altered capillary wall permeability in D; moreover the use of insulin, protein based, seems to impact on the mass transport through the dialyzer membrane. The proposed approach allows adding a new tile to the studies on how the diabetic pathology affects the response to the HD treatment. Objectives: Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become an accepted treatment for end-stage heart-failure. While patient management has improved over the past decades, limitations in caregiver resources necessitate efficient allocation. Decisions on the optimal setting of LVAD support currently occurs in intervals ranging from a few weeks to a few months. However, the optimal setting for LVAD support may change multiple times per minute. Thus, automation is the only viable solution to this problem. Physiological control promises to integrate the cardiac assist device into patient physiology even more closely, reacting to varying demands or specifying the load for training of the heart muscle. One important design consideration is the choice of feedback variable. Methods: Literature of the past two decades was collected and the presented physiological control concepts were clustered into categories corresponding to functional similarity of feedback variables. Results: It was found that most literature could be summarized into five categories. Control algorithms either used preload, heart rate, ventricular contraction, or afterload as feedback variables or modified the flowrate/headpressure relation. Discussion: Each of these categories contains information about the cardiac state. While preload variables, most closely resemble the native functioning of the left ventricle, they are inherently difficult to measure without using additional sensors. Chronotropic incompetence might be a limiting factor for heart rate based control. Ventricular functioning might fluctuate over time due to changes in inotropy while afterload is heavily regulated by other autoregulatory mechanisms. The headpressure/flowrate relation suffers from uncertainty regarding the origin of pressure changes. Combining elements of these five categories into one control concept might prove beneficial, as different information could be extracted for the controller, which could then be tuned by the physician. Objectives: Current understanding of membrane performance in hemodialysis implies that their permeability in terms of molecular weight cut-off must be restricted to a figure below the molecular weight of albumin, i.e. < 60.000. Nephrologists commonly request a maximal allowable albumin loss during a 4h treatment to be below 4g per session. Methods: Recent investigations have shown that the 3D-conformation of albumin is unstable and changes in e.g., uremia or liver failure. Thus, detoxification efficiency of albumin may decrease by about 70% and can be explained by a considerable reduction of albumin's binding constants for both pharmaceutical drugs and uremic retention solutes, as well as for exogenous toxins. As a result, free concentrations of such solutes increase in patient's blood and a higher toxicity is observed. Binding constants for defined uremic retention solutes, such as p-Cresylsulfate, are further affected by the simultaneous presence of other solutes, such as Indoxylsulfate. Results: Oxidative stress, as manifested in many dialysis patients, further promotes changes in albumin conformation. It's thus no surprise, that hemodialysis with protein-permeable membranes improves patient performance, as shown recently in a clinical trial by Nagai et al., (Ther Apher Dial, 2017; 21:378). They reported, that in a 7-year observation period, albumin leakage of 3g or more per HD session provided a better prognosis than albumin leakage less than 3g. Obviously, a clinically acceptable large albumin leakage provides beneficial effects on maintenance HD patients. Discussion: The performance of albumin as an adsorbing protein is inefficient during uremia and liver failure. Due to lower binding constants for pharma-drugs and uremic toxins following conformational changes in the sick state, albumin is unable to perform like in the healthy state. It should, thus, be removed. Identification of 3D-changes of albumin and thus its removal should become a priority. Cataract surgery followed by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in medicine. In 2020 alone, there are expected to be 32 million interventions. Here, ophthalmologists can look back on 70 years of experience. Since there is no blood perfusion at the lens, however, the IOL has a comparatively simple immunological special position. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists also have extensive experience with implants in the cornea, in the chamber angle of the eye and on the retina. In the presentation an overview will be given of the current implants and the necessary regulatory processes. In addition, own experiences (with medical devices) with the new requirements of the MDR will be described. Recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that post-dilutional haemodiafiltration (HDF) is associated with a benefit in survival. This benefit has been mainly observed in re-analyses of the primary data looking at the patients treated with the highest convection volumes (HCV-HDF). To obtain HCV-HDF, significant pressure has to be applied to the dialyser membrane and the dialysis systems are submitted to significantly stronger transmembrane pressure (TMP) constraints, frequently surpassing the limits proposed by the guidelines. Several automatized systems are proposed to avoid or overcome the alarms induced by the increases in convection and still maintain the volumes prescribed by the physician. The present overview will i) Critically analyse the evidence on the effect of convection volumes on survival. ii) Review the automatic systems presently proposed to achieve a given level of convection. iii) Analyse the possible pitfalls in determining the limits established by a dialysis monitor when performing HCV-HDF. iv) Explore a harmonised definition of the parameters that may drive the convection volumes during a dialysis procedure with the aim to help in better defining the Best Practice Guidelines for HCV-HDF. Objectives: Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is known to cause pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in kidney transplant recipients. We investigated the diagnosis and prognosis of HPV B19 infection by urine detection in kidney transplant patients with anemia and graft dysfunction. Methods: 1195 recipients (living donor/donation after citizen's death: 492/703) were performed kidney transplant in our center from January 2015 to January 2018. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with HPV B19 infection during follow-up (3.01%, 36/1195). Among those, fourteen HPV B19 infected patients underwent transplanted kidney biopsy, including 12 persons with PRCA and graft dysfunction and 2 recipients with donor-derived HPV B19 infection. We collected the urine samples for detection of HPV B19 DNA copies at the day of kidney biopsy. Meanwhile, the biopsy specimen were studied for immunohistochemical detection by using polyclonal mouse Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibody. Results: The mean diagnosis time of fourteen HPV B19 infected patients was 44 days (7-300days) after transplantation. The reticulocyte percentage was 0.1-0.2% and the mean hemoglobin level was 67 g/L (51-87 g/L). Among 12 biopsies with PRCA and graft dysfunction, 6 were diagnosed with T cell-mediated rejection (IA-IB-IIA), 3 borderline rejection, 2 without rejection signs and 1 was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). The patient, who was diagnosed with TMA, had performed ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. It displayed glomerular microthrombus and diffuse necrosis of renal tubules on renal biopsy. Despite the treatment of IVIG, the graft was ultimately lost. The immunohistochemical result of the TMA biopsy specimen was positive and the others were negative. The result of urine detection for HPV B19 virus DNA copies was >10 boolean AND 5/ml with TMA and the others were negative. Discussion: If the urine test is positive for HPV B19 DNA, parvovirus -associated kidney injury should be suspected. Hemodynamic simulations are increasingly used to assess the flow phenomena in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Based on detailed simulation results existing therapies such as coiling or stenting can be improved or novel approaches are tested. However, the accuracy of patient-specific blood flow acquisitions strongly depends on preliminary and highly interdisciplinary steps. These include for instance medical imaging, image reconstruction, image segmentation and acquisition of appropriate boundary conditions. To assess capabilities, but also limitations of state-of-art IA modeling techniques, international simulation challenges are frequently organized. These comparisons address single or combined steps along the simulation process. Within this talk, the most relevant competitions are presented and the main findings are summarized. In this regard, sources of error in the context of hemodynamic modeling are revealed and the awareness for standardized simulations is sharpened. Objectives: Heart failure (HF) is a critical healthcare issue and a primary source of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Globally, it is estimated that up to 100,000 people are candidates for heart transplantation, but only about 5800 transplants were performed in 2016. At Cleveland Clinic, we are developing a continuous-flow total artificial heart (CFTAH) in an attempt to provide a viable alternative to transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage HF. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic CFTAH is a double-ended centrifugal pump with only one moving part that is designed to passively self-balance left and right circulations without active intervention. The device has no mechanical bearings to wear out and is driven by an extremely reliable 3-phase brushless, sensorless motor. The nominal external dimensions of the latest version of our adult CFTAH design to be tested in-vivo were 98.4 mm in length, 62 mm in diameter, 160 cc in volume displacement and 486 g in weight without the cable. Results: Biocompatibility of the CFTAH has been demonstrated in two full-term 90-day in vivo tests, completed without the use of any anticoagulation. Since the conclusion of these tests, our team has been working on design improvements to further reduce susceptibility to thrombosis, enhance autoregulation, improve motor controller hardware, add clinically useful features to the control interface and enhance manufacturability. Discussion: Our results to date suggest that a small, mechanically and electronically simple, auto-regulated total artificial heart has significant potential to provide an important clinical option for HF patients. We discuss a novel method for hemolysis prediction in computational fluid dynamics, which avoids potential problems inherent to the traditionally used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The traditionally used Eulerian method computes a hemolysis index (HI) at the flow outlet by solving a transport partial differential equation (PDE) where the source term equals shear stress raised to some power (which is determined empirically), and then looks at the HI transported to the flow outlet. The largest contribution to HI typically occurs at the flow boundaries (walls), which is precisely the location where numerical noise is most likely to be inadvertently introduced, e.g., from sharp edges in the wall or from low quality mesh elements. This can cause errors in the Eulerian method because its PDE lacks a diffusion term, and consequently any numerical noise is transported to, and accumulates at, the flow outlet surface. We have not seen this potential problem occurring when using a Lagrangian method, although theoretically it could still occur. Regardless, a major disadvantage of the Lagrangian method is a large computational cost required to achieve reasonable accuracy. Instead of using one of the two traditional methods, we use a volume integral where the source term includes both shear stress and flow speed. In situations with sufficient mixing, such as in an LVAD, this approach predicts blood damage at least as well as either of the other methods, for a fraction of the computational cost, and avoids the numerical problems. The method also lends itself better to frozen rotor simulations, while the traditional methods prefer more costly time-dependent simulations. We present an example where the method is used to evaluate potential changes to a HM3-like rotor design. Objectives: A great and long pursued goal in cancer research is the development of a suitable culture system for expanding haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which can thereafter be successfully used in transplantations. Since HSCs only reproduce in their natural environment, novel systems try to mimic the in vivo niche of HSCs, the bone marrow, in many factors such as material rigidity, chemical and cellular compositions. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known to support HSC expansion. This effect is even greater when the cells are cocultured in a 3D environment. The aim of this project is to study the interactions of HSCs and MSCs in a conventional 2D culture compared with a 3D porous hydrogel, which was previously developed in our group. Methods: The influence of HSCs on MSCs and vice versa will be studied on a transcriptomic level by next generation sequencing and verified by qPCR, cytokine arrays and western blots. To regain the cells from the system we want to make our hydrogel degradable by introducing disulfide bonds, which can be cleaved by reducing agents. Afterwards the RNA will be fixed within the cells and these will be separated by magnetic cell sorting, previous to RNA isolation. Results: Previous experiments indicate that the 3D system has a positive effect on HSCs only in coculture with MSCs. With a deep insight into the transcriptomes of both cell types in coculture, we hope to identify key molecules playing a role in this phenomenon and in HSC expansion. Such key molecules shall further be tested for their influence on the coculture by inhibition or enhancement. Discussion: The HSC expansion in vitro while maintaining their stem cell character has been a major and challenging goal in research for more than 60 years. By finding and influencing key molecules of the HSC-MSC interaction, we hope to further develop our 3D hydrogel system and increase HSC expansion in vitro. Objectives: Small molecule drugs can be bound to plasma proteins. Examples are Apixaban (459 Da, 87% protein bound), Carvedilol (406 Da, 98% protein bound) or Calcitriol (416 Da, 99.9 % protein bound). In plasma, these drugs have a free and a protein bound fraction. Protein binding impacts the removal behavior of the drug during dialysis. The purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative model to describe the removal of these solutes, and validate the model experimentally. Methods: A mathematical model was developed by coupling the equations of transport in dialyzers reported in one of our previous studies, and mass balance equations reported in literature to include the effect of binding. Simulated HD treatments with human plasma were performed with 3 different types of commercial dialyzers having different membrane permeability to study the removal of Apixaban, Carvedilol or Calcitriol, expressed in terms of solute clearance. Additionally, the loss of albumin was quantified. Results: Experimental clearance results [ml/min] are given as mean +/- MAD from 3 independent experiments in the order of Apixaban / Carvedilol / Calcitriol. Calculated values are reported in brackets. Dialyzer 1 was tested in HDF mode, yielding clearance of 60 +/- 1.0 [61] / 41 +/- 1.8 [10]/ < 6 [0.5]. Dialyzer 2 tested in HD mode yielded clearance of 60 +/- 1.6[ 60] / 31 +/- 1.6 [10] / Discussion: Clearance of tested drugs was lower than expected for their nominal molecular weight. The levels scaled Apixaban > Carvedilol >> Calcitriol, which is inverse to their degree of protein binding (Apixaban < Carvedilol << Calcitriol). The degree of protein binding was revealed to be the actual critical determinant, rather than dialyzer design and operational mode. Drug clearance seemed to be driven by the proportion of the free fractions, as is reflected in the model by the increase of clearance for decreasing bound fraction. Objectives: In the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical applications, the foreign body response is an important issue. The healing of surrounding tissue often interferes with the function of an implanted biomaterial. Events like protein deposition, hemostasis, inflammation, tissue repair, infections and the encapsulation of the functional part of the implant are the main cause of failure of the implanted device. Methods: In this study biocompatible nanofilms are produced by means of a plasma polymerization process using a low-pressure magnetron-enhanced 15 kHz glow discharge. This process allows the precise control of the film nature and behaviour. The resulting hydrocarbon film has a thickness of a few nanometer and keeps therefore the inherent properties of the substrate material. Measurements on protein adsorption gave the possibility to tailor the thin films in the needed direction. This means to tailor a native secondary structure of in situ adsorbed proteins. Results: The nanofilms were investigated using different surface analytical methods. Also the interaction in contact with different biological sample materials was tested in-vitro. The precise measurement of the adsorbed proteins indicated a native secondary structure of proteins on these surfaces. Different in-vivo sensor dummies which are in contact with blood and soft-tissue were coated by these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. This stands in good correlation with the measurement of adsorbed proteins. Discussion: The first in-vitro results of the adsorption of blood proteins indicated already a very biocompatible character of these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. These coatings can open the door for many new applications in the field of new implants but also other biomedical products. Objectives: Human placenta tissue has great advantages to be used as tissue source due to its molecular composition and its availability as clinical waste product. In our previous studies, human placenta arteries were decellularized and showed low immunogenicity and a supportive environment for cell migration and proliferation. Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels are a widely-used tool in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To create placental ECM hydrogel (pECM-HG) decellularized arterial grafts were further processed by an enzymatic pepsin digestion. Methods: pECM-HG were biochemically analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize fiber structures. Cell adherence and migration assays were carried out on pECM-HG coated culture plates to confirm cytocompatibility of the material. As next step pECM-HG was used for coating of vascular grafts in a reseeding experiment using a perfused 3D bioreactor system. Furthermore, biomechanical properties of 3D hydrogels were tested by rheological measurements. Results: pECM-HG showed low amount of DNA residuals and preservation of cell interacting ECM proteins. SEM analysis revealed the formation of specific fibrous structures, dependent on respective hydrogel concentration. Cell binding and viability assays showed significantly enhanced cell adherence and increased proliferation rates when seeded on surfaces coated with pECM-HG (p<0.001) compared to controls. pECM-HG showed beneficial properties for cell reseeding on acellular vascular grafts in a flow bioreactor system. Discussion: We developed a hydrogel from human vascular tissue that is cytocompatible and supports cell adherence and proliferation. We hypothesize that this hydrogel has great potential due to its origin and composition. Further investigations on the hydrogel composition are ongoing. It is planned use the pECM-HG for 3D cell printing applications or as injectable hydrogel to support ischemic injury regeneration. Objectives: Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is undoubtedly the most widely used mechanical circulatory support system for a range of severe heart failure indications. Average duration of IABP use is 1-3 days, however its longer-term use has not been adequately studied. The objective of this work is to establish the extent to which the IABP duration has been used, and also to examine the clinical outcome pertaining to prolonged use of IABP, using meta-analysis of literature data. Methods: We defined IABP prolonged use as 7 days or longer; a choice based on a duration that is greater than double the current perceived average use. We systematically reviewed the literature (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) and identified 14 studies that have prolonged IABP use between 1968 - 2018. Patients indications included heart failure (refractory, congestive, end stage), ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Results: A total number of 1707 patients of both genders received prolonged IABP use with an overall average of 22.6 days. The studied cohort is split into: Group 1: n= 1683 adults, mean age 57.9 years, range 19-84 years old, average use of 21.2 days. Survival rate in this group was 64.4%. Group 2: n=24 infants and children, mean age 5.5 years, range 7 days-17.5 years old, average use 24 days. Overall mean survival rate to discharge was 62.5%. At a mean follow-up of 85 months, all 15 survivors were alive and well. Discussion: Due to its ease of insertion and relative low cost, IABP presents the first port of call in a wide range of heart failure scenarios. This analysis indicates that, age does not seem to be a significant parameter that affect outcomes of IABP long-term use. Although, IABP is perceived to be only a short-term support, its prolonged use is evident with successful outcomes. Further trials of IABP long-term use for children and adults is warranted to further establish the range of indications IABP can be utilised as a long-term support. Objectives: Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the dominating proteins in human plasma with its exceptional binding capacity plays an important role in storing and transporting different substances throughout the human circulatory system. Clinically used to treat a variety of diseases, particularly in liver failure therapy, pharmaceutical-grade HSA contains high amounts of stabilizers, such as Na-caprylate and N-acetyltryptophanate. These compounds represent potential risks to patients with restricted liver function. The aim of this study was to test if the elimination of stabilizers by adsorbent technique affects HSA's secondary structure. Methods: Albumin infusion solutions (BIOMED, Germany) were filtered using a commercial system Hepalbin (Albutec, Germany). Raman- and FTIR spectroscopy as well as DSC analysis were applied to analyze conformational changes in treated and untreated HSA samples. For Raman based studies different parameters such as object slides type, integration time, accumulations number and laser capacity were investigated. Results: Preliminarily results of the physical-chemical analyses showed some differences for filtered samples in comparison to the unfiltered ones. Raman and FTIR spectra exhibited both, peak shifts in characteristic HSA amide bands and an alteration in the peaks' shape. DSC thermograms revealed significant differences in denaturation temperatures of the compared samples. Discussion: A Raman shift in amide I band and changes in the alpha-helix/beta-sheet ratio detected via FTIR spectroscopy indicated a possible alteration in the HSA conformation after filtration. These findings were corroborated by DCS showing a tendency towards lower denaturation temperatures in samples after stabilizers removal. The results may contribute to finding a compromise between stability and high functional performance of HSA for the improvement of liver failure therapy. Objectives: The protein fibrinogen is important in blood coagulation and wound healing. Hence, nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are highly attractive as biomaterials. One currently used technique to prepare fibrinogen nanofibers in vitro is electrospinning. Since this technique uses organic solvents and high electric fields, which can impede the biological protein function, we have developed a novel technique to prepare fibrinogen scaffolds with physiological buffers. Methods: We introduced the novel method of salt-induced self assembly under controlled drying conditions to prepare nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to characterize the fiber morphology. We studied the secondary structure with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To assess the biocompatibility of our novel scaffolds we analyzed the proliferation of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with WST1 assays and studied the cell morphology with SEM. Results: Salt-induced self assembly reproducibly yielded fibrinogen nanofibers with overall scaffold dimensions in the centimeter range. SEM analysis revealed fiber diameters between 200 and 300 nm. By adding a customized fixation step after the fiber formation we fabricated either immobilized or free-standing fibrinogen networks depending on the underlying substrate material. With FTIR spectroscopy we found a higher content of beta-sheet structures for fibrinogen nanofibers in comparison to planar fibrinogen. 3T3 fibroblasts were found to proliferate well on fibrinogen nanofibers with cell numbers comparable to planar fibrinogen substrates. SEM analysis showed that 3T3 fibroblasts grew in close contact with fibrinogen nanofibers. Discussion: Our new self assembly process offers a well controllable and physiological biofabrication method for large-scale fibrinogen scaffolds. Based on the good biocompatibility results our fibrinogen networks are very promising candidates for a new class of wound dressings. Total artificial hearts (TAH) are used to restore quality of life to biventricular heart failure patients but can also introduce significant risks. Several features were included in to the BiVACOR design to mitigate some of the major risks, such as 1) device malfunction, 2) insufficient hemocompatibility, 3) ineffective physiological interaction, and 4) inappropriate device geometry. To achieve a durable design the BiVACOR TAH reduces mechanical wear by levitating a single rotating impeller in a magnetic field. To reduce the incidence of single fault failures, the levitation and drive systems incorporate backup features. Large clearance gaps in the blood flow path and cyclic speed variations assist hemocompatibility. Physiological interaction is improved via autonomous left/right outflow balancing, the ability to inherently adapt total outflow based on physiological conditions, and to respond to variations in filling volumes. Initial durability testing is ongoing with no device failures after 180 days. The redundant motor and hydrodynamic backup bearing maintain hemodynamic function when failure modes are induced. Preliminary NIH, platelet activation and vWF degradation during in-vitro tests show lower levels than implantable VADs. In-vivo results (1x90day, 3x30-day) confirm benchtop observations. When operated with either pulsatile or non-pulsatile outflow up to 15 l/min, or with the hydrodynamic backup bearing, pfHb ranged between 0.5-2mg/dL. The system can balance outflows under a wide variety of physiological conditions, while inherently adjusting flows by more than 4 l/min. Finally, device weight and size allowed a good anatomical fit in human cadavers with BSA >1.4m(2). By implementing the risk mitigating design features, the BiVACOR device aims to provide patients with a durable, hemocompatible, and physiological interactive TAH with suitable anatomical fit. Successful development of this device may ultimately lead to a long-term alternative to heart transplants. Objectives: Visualization of hemodynamics often represents a simplification of blood as a monophasic fluid. In this study, blood is used as a multiphase fluid. The aim is to fabricate artificial blood to visualize hemodynamics with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). More specific, micro beads (ArtErys), which mimic the erythrocytes, are fabricated with a membrane-emulsion-technology system (MET). This system is developed and compared with the results (e.g. ArtEry size) of three other methods: microfluidic, electro-spraying and air flow. Methods: The ArtErys are made of hydrogels (Agarose 0.3-0.7 wt.%) to match refractive index and biomechanics. For PIV tracking, particles (Sphericals (c), 20 mu m) are encapsulated directly into the ArtErys and are not added to the plasma where they might affect the hemodynamics. For the MET system, different oils (e.g. paraffin) are used as disperse phase. The Agarose/PIV mixture is pumped (50 to 100 ml/h) into a constant oil flow (5 to 40 ml/h) through a PTFE membrane (Reichelt Chemietchnik GmbH, pore size 60 mu m). The ArtErys are created during this process and transported away by the oil. The MET process is carried out in a heated water bath with a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results: The ArtEry size depends mainly on two parameters: the flow rate of the agarose/PIV solution and the flow rate of the oil. A flow rate of 80 ml/h Agarose/PIV solution leads to smallest bead sizes with a mean diameter of 150 mu m. High rates lead to merging of the ArtErys, which is reflected in a larger diameter. Furthermore, the bead size depends on the parameter oil flow rate. Here, a rate of 30 ml/h leads to the smallest beads. Discussion: The MET method has been successfully implemented to fabricate ArtErys with encapsulated PIV particles. Compared to the other methods, the MET system fabricates the biggest ArtEry sizes (MET: 150 mu m, microfluidic: 15 mu m, electro-spraying: 80 mu m, air flow: 100 mu m). Objectives: Since the latest revision of the Medical Devices (MDs) Directive, the European regulatory framework considers stand-alone software as a MD per se, as confirmed by the MD Regulation. The recent surge of AI tools, which promise to be ubiquitous soon, poses problems relative to their certification as MDs. In view of the already granted market approval in Europe and the USA for some AI-based MDs, we aimed to investigate the main relevant issues of such MDs' regulation. Methods: Unlike traditional SW as MDs, for which established standards already exist (e.g., IEC 62304, \"Software life-cycle processes\"), for AI tools there are very few specific standards. The definition of AI, or intelligence itself, is by no means universally accepted. Thus, we limited the scope of AI to Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL). Results: 1) ML/DL tools are data intensive, so that a critical issue is how to construct a representative set of input data. E.g., IEC 62304 recommends that the manufacturer include software system inputs and outputs, in the SW requirements: this is clearly too generic for a DL tool. 2) Guidelines for acceptable input data size should be drawn, for a given system/software architecture. Moreover, quality check of training data should always be executed, before SW training. Quality of ML/DL tools and of physical architecture is also relevant. 3) Generally, DL tools lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence it is difficult or impossible to assess to \"reasoning\" behind the algorithmic decisions. \"Explainable\" AI should be the standard, in order to rule out fuzziness in machine clinical decision making and impossibility to pinpoint the problem(s), in view of the legal responsibility for MD use. It has been found that DL performance conflicts with explainability, thus priority setting will be crucial. Discussion: The regulatory treatment of AI-based MDs needs improvements, in order to have safe and effective products, as well as wider societal acceptance. Objectives: The aim of this work is to design a reliable and efficient sheath for an implantable part of a device for the wireless inductive powering of artificial organs. Methods: Wireless inductive power transfer can help get rid of the problems of recharge and wired constant power supply to artificial organs. However, the design of the implantable part of the transcutaneous powering device, or so-called assembly, is complicated by the lack of a comprehensive solution of technical and medical problems. The assembly must be encapsulated in the sheath which requires the choice of a biocompatible and non-magnetic material. This eliminates the formation of eddy currents on the sheath, whereby negative influence on the energy transfer is minimized. At the same time, the material should have a low thermal conductivity (about 0.5 W / (m . K)) to prevent overheating of the tissue from the circuitry. The sheath of the assembly must have sufficient durability to protect the circuitry. The form-factor of the sheath should be minimized for the convenience of the patient (dimensions in the limit of 20 x 20 x 3 mm). Results: The sheath was developed for the assembly prototype. The assembly provides an output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignment up to 20 mm. The calculation and measurement were performed in the air and with the samples of \"skin-fat\" biological objects, in order to determine and verify the sheath characteristics. Discussion: We have developed and tested the assembly's sheath for inductive powering of artificial organs that meets technical and medical requirements. Objectives: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are used in medicine for targeted drug delivery to the area of cancer. There is the problem of remotely determining in vivo concentrations of MNPs. The aim of our work was to experimentally test acoustomagnetic method (AMM) for detecting MNPs in a model sample of a biological substance (BS). Methods: A colloidal solution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a mixture of oleic acid and kerosene was used as a model sample. The weight concentration of the MNPs in the solution was 0.15%, and the viscosity of the solution was close to the blood viscosity. To detect MNPs in solution, a special experimental setup was developed. The installation consists of an ultrasound generator, a permanent magnet, a glass container with a solution, an induction multi-turn coil near the glass tube, and a voltmeter as a measure of the voltage across the coil. Ultrasound causes periodic movement of the particles of the solution together with the MNPs along the container axis. The magnet orients the MNPs in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the container. As a result, the summation of MNPs creates an alternating magnetic field with an ultrasonic frequency in the coil area. An alternating voltage (U) arises on the coil, as measured by a voltmeter. Results: As measurements have shown, the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the concentration of MNPs in the field of action of the ultrasound and the magnet field, as well as the intensity of the ultrasound. In particular, when the intensity of ultrasound was at the level of 0.02 W/ cm2, U = 1mV was obtained. Discussion: The experimental results are consistent with the calculated estimates and suggest that AMM can be used to detect MNPs in a real BS. Considering that the magnitude of the constant magnetic field in these experiments was 0.1T, we can also conclude that this method is safe, more accurate, and easier to implement than traditional X-ray and MRT methods. Objectives: For a single hemodialysis session several hundred liters of water are consumed. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification facilities worsen contamination risk especially in developing countries. Here, we investigate the application of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM), which combines filtration and adsorption, for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate combined to high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma. Methods: We investigate the adsorption of lipo-polysacharide (LPS) by a MMM in both static and dynamic conditions. Dynamic adsorption of LPS is also investigated in presence of uremic toxins in human plasma. Diffusion experiments using dialysate contaminated with bacterial culture filtrates are also performed to assess the ability of the MMM to act as a safety-barrier to avoid transfer of pyrogens to the plasma. A membrane without sorbents is used as control and the obtained results are compared with literature studies using current dialysis membranes. Results: The MMM can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from dialysate compared to commercial dialysis membranes. No transfer of pyrogens was detected in the blood compartment, revealing safety-barrier properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously without compromising AC adsorption capacity. Discussion: We estimate that 0.15 m(2)of MMM is needed to remove the daily production of the protein-bound toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) device. Future studies would focus on the applicability of the MMM in wearable/portable artificial kidneys and in general for home-hemodialysis treatments. Objectives: Nearly half of all heart failure patients suffer from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With no effective treatment, a major clinical need is presented. The aim of this study was the hemo - and fluid dynamic investigation of a valveless pulsatile pump for HFpEF using in-vitro, ex-vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD), and 4D flow MRI imaging studies. Methods: The pump is a pneumatically driven pulsatile pump with a single valveless cannula that is to be implanted through the LV apex and is operated synchronously with the left ventricle. A prototype of the proposed pump system was fabricated. The pump was tested in an in-vitro hybrid mock loop system to evaluate its hemodynamic effect in four HFpEF phenotypes. Further hemodynamic evaluation was conducted by implanting the pump in an ex-vivo isolated heart model. CFD was employed for flow field analysis of two different pump designs-a symmetric and an asymmetric configuration. The results were validated by 4D flow MRI imaging of the respective prototypes. Results: In the in-vitro studies, the pump augmented cardiac output (CO) by 14 - 30% and reduced left atrial pressure (LAP) by 14 - 30%. Ex-vivo studies showed the similar hemodynamic trends: augmented CO by 20.0 +/- 9.7%, and reduced LAP by 57.5 +/- 14.4%. Fluid dynamic simulations revealed good correlation with the respective 4D flow measurements. The asymmetric configuration disclosed superior fluid dynamic performance with 94.5% of the initial blood being exchanged after 3 beats. Discussion: It was demonstrated that the valveless pulsatile device can improve hemodynamics in HFpEF patients by augmenting CO and reducing LAP. Appropriate washout of the pump chamber is achieved by a persisting vortex evolving within the asymmetric design throughout each pump cycle. By demonstrating the hemodynamic effects and promising fluid dynamic performance of the pump, feasibility of the system as a potential treatment option for HFpEF patients is supported. Objectives: In this work, the denaturation behaviour of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous nanodispersions during heating was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have been discussed. The calculation procedure for estimating the parameters of laser treatment on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry data is presented. Accurate calculation of the optimal parameters of laser treatment, under which there is complete denaturation of albumin and the solid nanocomposite material is forming, will minimize the thermal damage of the connected tissues, while not reducing the tensile strength of the seam. Methods: Laser solders based on water dispersion of BSA (25 % w/w) and SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 % w/w) were used for differential scanning calorimetry study. Studies were conducted in hermetically sealed crucibles with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 20 degrees C/min. Results: The specific energies and denaturation temperatures of the laser solders were measured. The use of SWCNTs led to a decrease in the specific energy of denaturation from 4.11 to 3.27 J/g and a denaturation temperature from 87.2 to 86.9 degrees C. The activation energy of albumin denaturation in laser solder has doubled during use SWCNTs Discussion: Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have been discussed, namely the changes in temperature characteristics of denaturation processes and the partial thermal destabilization of albumin. The energetic parameters of laser treatment have been estimated on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry data. The values obtained are optimal for complete BSA denaturation resulting in formation of solid nanocomposite material with minimal thermal damage of the connected tissues and sufficient tensile strength of the seam. Objectives: Clot formation in the membrane oxygenator is a serious complication in long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the blood vessels, nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric oxide synthase on the endothelial cells suppresses both aggregation/activation of platelets and adhesion/activation of leukocytes. Therefore, biocompatibility of the membrane oxygenator may be improved by the addition of NO gas to the sweep gas. The objective of the present study was to determine, using a rat ECMO model, whether addition of NO gas to the blood can suppress blood coagulation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 350 to 400 g were used for the experiments. After the rats were anesthetized, extracorporeal circulation was established by guiding the blood from the right jugular vein into the left femoral vein. Heparin was administered by bolus injection (0.7 unit/g-rat) only at the start of the ECMO. Polymethyl pentene membranes were used for the oxygenator. The sweep gas (NO: 0, 100 or 200 ppm, O2: 30%, CO2: 5%, N2: balance) was added to the blood via the oxygenator. During the experiment, the arterial pressure, oxygenator inlet pressure, venous pressure, activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), and methemoglobin (Met-Hb) concentration were measured. After circulation, the hemoglobin (Hb) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the eluate from the residual blood in the oxygenator were measured. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was stably performed for 4 hours. There were no differences in the ACT during the experiment among the three groups. The amount of Met-Hb was below 10% in the NO group. The Hb content and LDH activity in the eluate were significantly lower in the 200-ppm NO group than those in the 0 ppm NO. Discussion: The amount of Met-Hb in the NO group indicates that there is no adverse effect related to Met-Hb. The Hb content and LDH activity indicate that the NO contained in the sweep gas inhibited blood coagulation in this rat extracorporeal circulation model. Objectives: Data from the WAA apheresis registry was investigated regarding patients treated with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a tool to modulate immune response in various diseases. Methods: 381 patients (34% women) had been treated with ECP for a total of 10668 procedures. The mean age was 48 years (+/- 18, range 3-81 years). Estimation of quality of life was made using grade 0 (suicidal) up to 10 (best ever) and health quality grade 1 (Bed ridden, ICU condition) up to 10 (athletic). Adverse events were analyzed. ANOVA comparisons were used. Results: Most patients were treated due to graft versus host disease (GVHD, n=284) and other hematological diseases (n=34). Adverse events were registered in 5.8% of the first treatments and in 2.1% of the subsequent procedures. Severe adverse events were present in 0.4% of all procedures. No patient died due to the procedure. Tingling and stitching were the most common side effects. For those with GVHD the QoL was initially at a mean 6.3 (+/- 1.5, range 2-10) and improved significantly within 10 procedures and the Health Condition estimate improved significantly within 9 procedures and improved further with added procedures. Discussion: Photopheresis is an established therapy with few side effects. The present data indicate that approximately 10 procedures are necessary to note significant effect to GVHD. Objectives: The most fundamental goal in improving quality of care in hospitals is to eliminate unnecessary deaths. AIM: Three-year mortality and quality of care between 2015-2017 were evaluated in a tertiary nephrology clinic. Methods: Audit of 392 deaths was carried out to reveal prevalence of suboptimal clinical observations. Admission pressure, direct admissions avoiding public healthcare system, severity of clinical conditions, elderly persons dying in the hospital, time of admissions and death were evaluated. Results: In 2015 and 2016, 5.5 of every 100 inpatients died in the hospital, and this proportion decreased to 4.9 in 2017, with high percentage of patients who died in the first 24 or 48 hours from admission. The percentage of hospital deaths occurring in combination with AKI rose from 17% up to 37% over the three-year study period. Many patients who died with worsening CKD, were not ever referred to a nephrologist. More than half of patients were admitted on duty and died over weekends. About 5% of the hospital deaths were among patients aged 85 and over, and in 2017 that number rose up to 10%. Patients who died were seriously ill, at least 17% had malignancy. Most of the cardiovascular deaths were directly caused by ischemic stroke. Discussion: In this study we did not find patients with preventable deaths. The results indicated that patients were seriously ill, elderly, some being admitted to hospital to die. Some of the patients were kept long period prior to death because of shortage on certain facilities. There is admission pressure and other external factors contributing to high burden in treatment of the dying patients. Still, further effors are necessary for further providing and auditing health quality of care. Objectives: Human immune cells have been produced using Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) guidelines and have been tested in clinical studies for a number of diseases, for which still no or only inadequate alternative therapies are available. Examples include several cancer entities, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe autoimmune disorders and chronic infections. Despite many in vitro or in animal studies report positive outcomes after immune cell therapy, convincing results showing the benefits of ATMP in clinical studies are rare. Part of this discrepancy in the outcome of the clinical studies in comparison to the in vitro and in animal studies may be caused by the manufacturing of immune cells for clinical trials. Cells prepared for clinical trials were mostly manufactured using archaic, scarcely controlled and incomparable production processes and stringent analytical methods for assessing proliferation and differentiation of the immune cells during the manufacturing process were not applied. Methods: The production of ATMPs is first of all dependent on the donor specific biology, which significantly varies from one donor or patient, respectively, to another (biological heterogeneity). In case of immune cell therapy, the manufacturing process is key for cytotoxic function and is the basis for the biological activity of the cells after injection into the patient. Results: The challenge for future clinical trials therefore is to reproducibly provide a sufficient number of biologically active cells of appropriate quality preferably in accordance with quality manufacturing guidelines (e. g. Good Manufacturing Practice, ICH etc.). Only using cells which have been produced under these rigorous quality control regimes will allow the conduction of clinically meaningful trials. Discussion: The talk presents a survey and discusses consequences on future requirements for manufacturing processes of products for immune cell therapies. Objectives: Cryopreservation plays a major role in the storage of tissues that are kept for subsequent transplantation. A wide variety of tissues intended for transplantation for a patient are stored in this way. In addition to the assignment to a suitable recipient, it must be ensured in particular that a sufficiently long period of time is available for infection diagnostic analyses. Cryopreservation of tissue is therefore routine in everyday tissue medicine. Methods: As is well known, the success of low temperature storage depends in particular on coordinated freezing and storage processes, in the optimization of which many research approaches have already been investigated. In contrast to these well-known principles of important parameter adjustment in this context, little attention is paid to optimizing the freezing process in the daily routine of tissue medicine. In fact, for some applications the suboptimal storage of tissue is not critical, as no vital cells are necessary or desired. Results: This reduces the process to a minimum and eliminates the need for additives such as cryoprotective agent (CPA) or animal/human serum. This is particularly important for tissue preparations which, as in Germany, require a medicinal product approval by a competent authority. Any change to the process must be first approved by the competent authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI). Optimizing the freezing process would therefore entail a new approval procedure. If the changed process was not previously known in the EU, a clinical study is also required. Discussion: For this reason, the conditions are not improved in case of doubt, although it is known that this could lead to a higher quality of the tissue after thawing. Less toxic CPA could simplify the approval procedure and thus contribute to improved tissue storage for transplantation. The same applies to the cryopreservation of tissue engineered products. Vascular access is a key issue for survival for uremic patients that need acute or chronic dialysis. In acute settings the use of central venous catheters, holding two luminae, are most commonly used in the intensive care for continuous or intermittent hemodialysis. Such catheters may be of acute type or a chronic type containing a separate cuff to limit bacterial invasion into the vessels. Another option is to place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. If using the right technique, this catheter can be surgically inserted in local anesthesia and could be used directly postoperatively for acute but also chronic peritoneal dialysis. For chronic hemodialysis (HD) the preferable option is to place an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the lower arm. This results in enlargement of the vein, and partly fibrosis, that allows for frequent punctures leaving no material externalized after the end of a HD procedure. A problem is the development of vascular stenosis and thrombosis that need interventions in at least 50% of patients within one year. When the AVF fails an option is to insert a graft (AVG). This may be either a biologic or synthetic graft interpositioned between the feeding artery and a more proximal vein below the elbow instead of the local vein that usually is occluded. If this option even fails, the patient has to rely on a sufficient permanent central dialysis catheter where complication such as bacterial contamination and occlusions are problems. To avoid such catheters a dream for future would be a graft as AV access that is made of an autologous biodegradable material that has physiological characteristics that prevent stenosis and clotting and also is possible to easy correct in its diameter to adjust for the volume of blood returned/minute to the heart to avoid congestive heart failure. Objectives: It has been observed that the in-vivo dialyser clearance for small solutes is not constant during a hemodialysis (HD) session. This may influence the choice of the value to be measured and reported. We investigated the presence of trends in the clearances of urea and creatinine, and how it impacts their values. Methods: Diffusive clearances were calculated for urea and creatinine from dialysate concentration data measured in 25 patients who underwent 3 consecutive HD sessions each. Clearance values were obtained for each hour (at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240 minutes). The significance of the observed trend in the data was statistically tested, as was any difference between the values at 2 and 3 hours, and the average clearance during the session. Results: Urea clearance showed an overall increase from the start of HD (by +10.1 +/- 19.3 mL/min, p = 0.0002) while creatinine clearance decreased (by -30.7 +/- 17.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). For urea, there was, however, a significant increase during the first hour (by +26.5 +/- 16.3 mL/min, p < 10(-4)) which was not observed for creatinine. Starting from 2 hours, both clearances decreased significantly, but the overall drop for creatinine was twice that for urea (by -34.1 +/- 15.7 vs. -16.3 +/- 19.8 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). As a consequence of these different trends, clearance at 2 h, 3 h, and the time-average clearance were not significantly different for urea (199.2 +/- 25.9 mL/min, p = 0.18), whereas they were so for creatinine (2 h: 115.9 +/- 26.3 mL/min vs. 3 h: 106.2 +/- 29.2 mL/min vs. average: 109.7 +/- 26.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). Discussion: A decrease in clearance during HD can be expected because of the progressive clogging of the dialyzer membrane's pores. It is not clear however the reason for the higher decrease in creatinine compared to urea. Our results suggest anyway that the time at which creatinine clearance is measured in-vivo should be clearly reported, as the difference during the session might be as high as 30%. Objectives: Currently, there are no reliable internal treatment options for large segmental bone defects. The objective of this study is to develop an alternative treatment for a young male patient with a huge 180mm diaphyseal tibial bone defect, who was already recommended amputation. Methods: A modular add-on system is developed for a commercially available motorized bone lengthening nail (Ellipse Technolo-gies, USA). The system allows bifocal segmental transport of osteotomized bone segments. By this, the bone defect is filled from two sides. A wire rope hoist shall ensure that the bone can overcome the distance from both sides, which re-duces the time of healing and the amount of implanted parts. A 3D-printed model of the patient's bone segments helps to design the implant system itself and the handling which includes fixation, transport and explantation. Results: The results show in accordance to previous studies that the developed implant system effectively transports both osteot-omized transport bone segments. The wire rope hoist mechanism and the modular construction works as planned. The implant system can be explanted successfully. Discussion: In this study, we present an individualized modular add-on implant solution. The advantage of the modular setup is that many parts can be manufactured in universal sizes. This method of bone reconstruction could help many patients, who suffer from large critical size defects. Among the various possible embodiments of Advanced Therapies and in particular of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to regenerate tissue defects is one of the key issues. The scaffolds should be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are exploring the use of adult MSCs, namely obtained from the bone marrow for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as the perivascular region of the umbilical cord (Wharton's Jelly). We are currently involved in a European consortium aiming at developing films with antimicrobial properties to be used in hospitals to cover surfaces that are prone to facilitate the transmission of infections. Those films use surface topographies and natural-derived oils to ensure the needed antibacterial properties to the films. This talk will review our latest developments of functionalized biomaterials and scaffolds in combination with stem cells for advanced biomedical devices and therapies. Objectives: Corwave LVAD is being developed to employ gentle oscillation of a membrane to propel blood, based on the wave motion of swimming fish. The pump output can be readily tuned by adjusting membrane oscillation frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this project was to increase the hydraulic efficiency, implement a physiologic pulsatility control algorithm, and confirm performance in animal implants. Methods: The fluid path of the pump was simulated by Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) computational fluid dynamic analysis in COMSOL. Membrane size, oscillation frequency, oscillation magnitude, and the blood flow path were modeled and refined to improve hydraulic performance and eliminate areas of flow stagnation. Pumps were then tested in blood analogs and blood in mock circulation loops and in vitro hemolysis testing. Non-hermetic prototype pumps were implanted in a total of 25 sheep for acute and chronic implants. Results: Design simulations and individual component testing resulted in a pump which can generate 6+ LPM of blood flow against physiologic pressures with maximum shear rates orders of magnitude lower than those of rotary blood pumps. Mock loop testing demonstrated the pumps have \"flat\" HQ (pressure vs. flow) curves. Three control methods were developed: fixed, asynchronous pulsatile, and synchronous pulsatile. Pulsatile modes generated dP/dt>400 mmHg/s using sensorless detection of native ventricle systole. Animal implants demonstrated low hemolysis and an absence of renal infarcts, but were limited to about a week in duration due to the non-hermetic sealing of the pumps. Discussion: Application of robust computational simulation and bench top testing have produced a unique new kind of VAD, offering the flow capacity and reliability of rotary pumps, but adding physiologically relevant pulsatility without excessive shear rates. Future efforts will implement full hermeticity to extend animal study durations and confirm von Willebrand Factor compatibility. Objectives: To investigate the colonization potential of Ovine Endothelial Progenitor Cells (OEPCs) on thermoplastic silicone-based polyurethane (TSPU) polymer under static condition. Methods: Functionalised TSPU (F-TSPU) was prepared by first subjecting the TSPU nonwovens to plasma treatment, followed by sterilization with 70% ethanol for seven minutes and then coupling with VEGF under sterile conditions. TSPU without any additional treatment or modification, identified as NF-TSPU, were used as control. OEPCs were seeded at the density of 5x10(4) cell/cm(2) onto square 4 cm(2) sized polymers under static conditions. Samples were taken at three time points: 1, 3 and 7 days. Samples were examined through live/dead staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to check the progression of cellular colonization on the polymer. MTS assay was used to quantify the metabolic activity of the cells on the polymer. Results: Cells seeded on the polymer surface were clearly visible on the SEM images. On day 3, the cells could be observed as patches on surface but did not cover all the surface. By day 7, the cells had almost filled the polymer surface. In case of F-TSPU, at Day 7, the underlying fiber pattern of the polymer could be observed on the cell sheet covering the polymer. Whereas this feature was not seen for NF-TSPU, indicating that the cells attached firmly to F-TSPU compared to NF-TSPU. Bright green fluorescence was observed on samples that underwent live/dead staining, indicating presence of live cells. Only a few red spots, representing dead cells, were seen. The metabolic activity on NF-TSPU was quantified to be higher than in the F-TSPU, though the difference was not statistically significant. Discussion: Static cell seeding experiments showed that OEPCs were able to attach and grow on the surface of both types of TSPU. These are promising results suggesting that TSPU holds potential for engineering of a new generation of heart valve prostheses, which will be assessed in pre-clinical animal models in the near future. Objectives: To investigate the impact of rotational speed modulation on VAD hemodynamics by comparing the effects induced by the artificial pulse in the HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) to those induced by the Lavare cycle in the HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA). Methods: We compared the effect of speed modulation to a baseline case with constant speed and pressure head in both HM3 and HVAD using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations employed high spatial (10(7) elements) and temporal (2 degrees per time step) resolution and one-way coupling to a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the cardiovascular system for physiologic boundary conditions. Lagrangian particle tracking was implemented to probe viscous and total stresses along cell paths. Results were validated against experimental pressure-flow (HQ) curves. Results: LPM results showed that HM3 and HVAD follow drastically different HQ loops during speed modulation, reflecting differences in pump characteristics, modulation rate and magnitude and associated fluid inertial effects. In the HM3, pump flow varied between -1.2 and 8.8 L/min during the artificial pulse vs. 3.7 to 7.1 L/min in the HVAD during the Lavare cycle. Induced aortic pressure pulses were comparable (11.3 vs 13.2 mmHg). CFD results revealed higher baseline shear stresses in the HVAD than in the HM3, coherent with previous studies. In both pumps, stresses were highest during flow acceleration. Sudden flow deceleration during the artificial pulse destabilized the flow and thereby also increased turbulence and total stresses on particles. Discussion: While speed modulation may contribute to pump wash out and pulsatility, it may also increase flow disturbances and shear. By relating shear stress to the rate and magnitude of the speed changes, this study sheds light on the impact of the imposed accelerations on the stress fields. This is of relevance for the establishment of both built-in and physiologically-controlled speed modulation sequences. Objectives: Thrombotic deposition is a major consideration in the development of implantable cardiovascular devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that fluid mechanical shear micro-gradients play a critical role in thrombogenesis. The goal of the present work is to develop a predictive computational model of platelet activation and deposition that can be used to assess the thrombotic burden of cardiovascular devices. We have developed a comprehensive model of platelet-mediated thrombogenesis which includes platelet transport in the blood flow, platelet activation induced by both agonists generated at sites of vascular injury and shear micro-gradients, kinetics and mechanics of platelet adhesion, and changes in the local fluid dynamics due to the growth of a thrombus. Methods: A 2D computational model was developed using the multi-physics finite element solver COMSOL 5.3a. The model can be described by a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction equations, and it comprises 7 species: resting and activated platelets, agonists that induce thrombosis, and an anticoagulant agent. Platelet adhesion at the surface was modeled via flux boundary conditions. Using a moving mesh for the surface, thrombus growth and consequent alterations in blood flow were modeled. In the case of a stenosis, the notions of shear stress-induced platelet activation in the acceleration zone and platelet deposition in the expansion zone downstream of the stenosis were studied. Results: The model provides the spatial and temporal evolution of thrombosis in the flow field. The computed density of platelets adherent to the surface was validated against experimental data. The results confirm the importance of considering both mechanical and chemical activation of platelets. Discussion: The developed model represents a potentially useful tool for the optimization of the design of the cardiovascular device flow path. Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of glucose concentration in the culture medium on metabolism and viability of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with the human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) on polysulfone semipermeable flat membranes. Methods: Cells were isolated from umbilical veins and arteries obtained by Caesarean section. Membranes with a surface area of 2 cm2 were covered with fibronectin to promote cells' attachment and then were placed in specially designed inserts. Cultures were carried out in 12-well plates filled with culture medium containing glucose in normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) concentration. The HUVEC and HUASMC were seeded on separate membranes or on both sides of the same membrane with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Cultures have been conducted in standard conditions (37oC, 5% CO2) for 7 days. Activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell viability were analyzed using the flow cytometry (with DCFDA test and Annexin V / 7AAD test, respectively). Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: In the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC the ROS activity was lower by 17% in the normal than in high glucose concentration. In normal glucose concentration the ROS activity of the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC was lower by 8% than in HUVEC cultured separately, whereas in high glucose concentration it was higher by 19%. Viability of HUVEC cultured separately in normal glucose concentration was higher by 4% than in high glucose concentration. Microscopic visualization of cells did not reveal any morphological differences. Discussion: In terms of the ROS activity the obtained preliminary results indicate a beneficial effect of HUASMC on HUVEC co-cultured in normal glucose concentration. The opposite tendency was observed in high glucose concentration. Objectives: Continuous rhythm monitoring is useful for predicting, determining and treating a large class of diseases. An implantable heart monitor is useful for this purpose. it has small dimensions and records events over a timeframe measured in years. The objective of the study is to develop methods and algorithms for determining QRS-complexes and disorders in the work of the heart. Methods: Several sources were used to obtain the ECG: large collections of recorded physiologic signals PhysioBank and BioModule BioHarness 3. Records of database have annotations with tags of QRS-complexes and conclusions of doctors. BioModule BioHarness 3 record lead V4 or V5 dependent on position electrodes. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hz. The records were made on the basis of I.M.Sechenov University Clinical Hospital No.1, Russia. The monitor of physiological parameters and the device for daily monitoring of ECG was installed by the patient simultaneously. Recording was carried out for 24 hours simultaneously on both instruments. The device for daily monitoring of ECG is used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the developed methods. MATLAB was used to implement algorithms. Results: Testing the algorithm with PhisioNet database resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.21% and a mean specificity of 99.49%. Testing the algorithm with Biomodule 3 resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.02% and a mean specificity of 93.69%. 16 records were analyzed. The analyzer gave an incorrect result in 2 cases. Discussion: A careful study of records revealed that algorithm sets false tags in the absence of contact between the electrodes and the surface of the human body. The device for daily monitoring of ECG continues to operate normally at the same time. A careful study of the annotations PhysioNet showed that they contain errors. Some records have been shortened or excluded for this reason. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to improve the design of the current commercial cannula being used by clinicians in order to minimise the blood flow stasis and thus avoid thrombosis in ECMO drainage cannula Methods: A CFD simulation is used in order to determine the optimum desing for the drainage cannula. The improved cannula design was fabricated and validated in-vitro using particle image velocimetry. Results: 16 different cannula designs were simulated and results were analysed in terms of velocity and mass flow rate at side holes and different sections of the cannula. Different parameters including side holes diameter, number, spacing, distance to the cannula tip, and angle relative to flow direction were investigated. Simulation results were in agreement with PIV. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the improved drainage cannula can significantly reduce blood flow stasis, and potentially thrombosis, in patients receiving ECMO. Objectives: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the constructive and personal characteristics of the wireless energy transfer system on the temperature distribution in biological tissues. The basic parameters of the transcutaneous energy transfer system, such as transmitted power, efficiency and displacements, were taken into account. The patient's personal characteristics, such as the thickness of biological tissue layers, were also taken into account. To obtain data on the level of thermal damage, Henriques and Moritz study was used. Methods: The temperature data was obtained using the numerical solution of a bioheat equation by the finite element method. This article mathematically evaluates thermal injury based on Henriques and Moritz study, in which damage can be represented as the speed of a chemical process. Results: The temperature distributions in the tissues corresponding to the following types of displacements were obtained: axial, lateral, angular and also for the case where there are no displacements. Also the temperature distributions in tissues with different structures were obtained. Further, the temperature values at the maximum heating points were used to estimate thermal damage to the tissues. Discussion: It was established that when a wireless energy transfer system is operated without displacements, the severity of thermal injury does not exceed the threshold corresponding to a first-degree burn. It was also found that the patient's personal characteristics are influenced by the temperature distribution in the case when a change in the thickness of a layer of biological tissue occurs in the region of the nearest heat source. Objectives: The objective of this work is the development of a two-phase blood model fluid for the use in upscaled flow models. In large scaled models of different flow geometries, frequently used water-glycerol mixtures are not sufficient because in critical regions with small gaps, e.g. between the rotor and the wall in cardiac support systems, the two-phases of blood have a great influence on the flow. Therefore, it is necessary that the model fluid represents both phases of blood: the plasma and the cells. Methods: Transparent alginate beads were used as a model of red blood cells. A water-glycerol mixture was used as a model fluid for plasma. The alginate beads made up about 40 % of the volume to model the proper hematocrit. Furthermore, the beads have a slightly higher density than the surrounding medium and keep floating once in motion. This was achieved by embedding hollow glass particles in the spheres that have a density <1.0 kg/l, also enabling particle tracking and flow analysis using the Particle Image Velocimetry method. A camera tracks the flow path of the beads through the required geometry. Reynolds similarity was maintained. Results: Flow analysis has been performed in an upscaled model of blade and gap of a ventricular assist device. Compared to a water-glycerol mixture, the proposed blood model fluid enabled the visualization of the strong influence of the two phases on the flow. Because of their transparency, it was possible to visualize the flow field at several layers in the fluid by choosing the appropriate light sections. Discussion: The proposed blood model fluid showed promising results in an initial case. Moreover, the results of the experiment lead to a possible optimization of the geometry of future rotor blades in blood pumps in order to reduce hemolysis. Further channel geometries will be explored. In the long term, the model can be used for experiments on flow analysis and optimization in blood pumps or as a validation model for CFD-codes to calculate multiphase flows. Objectives: FTR, the death rate among patients with complications, is an emerging quality metric, that has received an increasing focus in the last years. Concerning the management and outcome in life-threatening complications due to ECMO-insertion there are only few reports available. We report the successful rescue therapy in two patients of our hospitals large ECMO-patient cohort with severe ARDS who experienced right ventricular (RV)-perforation after v-v-ECMO-cannula insertion by the Seldinger's wire. Methods: RV perforation was assumed by deteriorating hemodynamics and immediate echo-cardiography showing cardiac tamponade during ECMO-cannula insertion. In cases of two patients an immediate bedside sternotomy was performed and the diagnosis verified. The source of bleeding was controlled and the tamponade was cleared. Either patient was transferred to the OR after ROSC for a definitive hemostasis and subsequent optimally controlled cannula placement. Results: Both patients survived this life-threatening event without neurological complications or further bleeding as well as no infections of the wounds. In Patient 1 the ECMO-therapy was not instituted immediately but later. This patient was weaned from ECMO after one week, survived six months but finally died due to an underlying disease. In Patient 2 switching the v-v- to an a-v-ECMO in the acute setting lead to a sufficient circulation during CPR. This patient was completely weaned from ECMO after 2 weeks and was finally discharged to rehabilitation after two months. Discussion: Successful management of seriously complicated ECMO- insertion is possible. The provision of an immediate bedside operative therapy and every kind of circulatory support to achieve ROSC seem to be essential in this setting. By reason of this concept a No-FTR situation could be achieved, which depicts a positive marker for quality of care for ECMO patients. Objectives: Blood trauma is an unintended consequence of mechanical circulatory support. Evidence indicates that exposure to high shears may induce sublethal changes to blood cells and also overt cell destruction. To determine whether such changes in blood properties have a functional impact on microcirculatory function, we examined the effect of surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass on the rheological properties of blood and also direct assessments of cell flux in the microcirculation. Methods: Thirty individuals requiring elective coronary artery bypass graft (n = 15) or valve surgery (n = 15) volunteered to participate. Dependent variables were collected prior to use of cardiopulmonary bypass, after 60 min of being on pump, and in the post-surgical period. Blood analyses included measurements of blood and plasma viscosity, red cell deformability, red cell aggregability, mechanical sensitivity of red cells, and levels of haemolysis, among others. Microcirculatory function was assessed using incident dark field visualisation of the sublingual vessels. Results and Discussion: Initial findings of this project indicate that blood viscosity and red cell aggregability are significantly affected by 60 min of cardiopulmonary bypass; these measures do not restore following the early post-surgical period. Microcirculatory assessments reveal altered transit and velocities of red cells, potentially indicating a link between biophysical assessments of blood and microcirculatory function. Extended presentation of this ongoing study will be presented, and discussed in the context of the secondary complications that still plague circulatory support patients. Objectives: Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), in which granulocytes and monocytes are removed from the patient's whole blood, is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of the present study was to clarify the effects of the anticoagulation methods used on blood clot formation in the column during GMA. Methods: Extracorporeal circulation was established for 60 minutes in male Sprague Dawley rats. A small column filled with 0.7 g of cellulose diacetate beads was used. We administered heparin at a total dose of 0.5 U/g by 2 different administration methods: the bolus administration method (single bolus administration prior to extracorporeal circulation) and the half bolus and half continuous administration method. During extracorporeal circulation the arterial pressure, column inlet pressure, venous pressure, and activated clotting time (ACT) were measured. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the eluate of the residual clots was measured after the extracorporeal circulation. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was performed stably for 60 minutes without events like in-circuit coagulation, in both groups. The ACT reached its peak value within 30 minutes in the bolus administration group, to decline gradually thereafter; on the other hand, in the half bolus and half continuous administration group, the ACT remained nearly constant during the extracorporeal circulation. The Hb concentration in the eluate was significantly lower in the bolus administration group than in the half bolus and half continuous administration group. Discussion: The results indicated that even for the same total dose of heparin, clot formation in the column was influenced by the method of administration. We concluded that bolus administration of heparin, which led to early peaking of the ACT value was more effective to reduce residual blood clotting in the column as compared to half bolus and half continuous administration. Objectives: Suction at the inlet of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) is common and known to cause adverse events. It occurs when tissue is drawn towards the cannula, thus leading to a reduced or even ceased flow. Moreover, the sudden occlusion can cause flow situations inside the device to be dramatically different from typical operation. The objectives were to quantify the effect of suction on the rotor bearing of an LVAD in an advanced development status and to mitigate unfavorable effects on the ongoing therapy and pump performance. Methods: A custom-made suction module was integrated into an established, active mock circulation loop upstream of an LVAD. This module comprises a membrane that can occlude the inflow cannula depending on the pressure in its fluid chamber relative to an adjustable air pressure chamber. The LVAD is equipped with rotor position sensors for online position tracking. Suction was initiated by reducing venous return and thus pump inlet pressure or by actively increasing air pressure in the respective chamber. The tests were performed with active and inactive suction speed control algorithms. Results: Spontaneous suction by reducing venous return was unlikely for the LVAD under test independently of the stationary air pressure applied. By actively provoking suction, increased radial force on the rotor was observed with uncharacteristic movement of the rotor. The radial gap remained satisfactory for all operational points and patient scenarios investigated. Suction was accurately detected by the controller and the speed reduced accordingly, thus leading to a relieve of the suction event. Discussion: Ventricular suction is a critical event in two ways as it negatively affects the LVAD therapy and secondly provokes uncharacteristic forces that might be critical for device performance. Future research is needed to ensure that experimental models of suction represent the variety of supported ventricles accurately. Objectives: Human amniotic membrane (AM) is employed in a broad field of applications as a wound dressing, corneal treatment, and scaffolding material. However, mechanical properties of native membranes vary depending on the zone of the placenta where the AM is obtained. For this reason, mimicking the AM through tissue engineering is a way to obtain a membrane with standardized properties. One technique to mimic the morphology of the extracellular matrix of AM is electrospinning. With electrospinning, a nanometric arranged similarly to the AM extracellular matrix made of different polymeric blends could be obtained. In addition, the correct storage is a key point in order to guarantee the availability of such tissue-engineered constructs for clinical applications. Methods: The AM extract is first prepared from native material and then freeze-dried. Afterwards, the AM-based scaffolds are obtained using blend electrospinning of polyethylene oxide and freeze-dried AM. Structural and compositional properties are assessed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The mechanical properties are evaluated by static mechanical testing before and after cryopreservation. The scaffold is then seeded with multipotent stromal cells. The biocompatibility of the tissue-engineered AM is analyzed using cytotoxicity assay. Results: The tissue-engineered membrane presents a nanostructured morphology similar to the extracellular matrix of AM. The compositional results can detect the presence of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid in the final material. Preliminary results present changes in the mechanical properties related to the cryopreservation. The fabrication technique for the tissue-engineered AM seemed not to alter the biocompatibility with stem cells. Discussion: The AM is ideal for treatment of different tissues, and in combination with polymeric materials by electrospinning, it could be a suitable candidate for a tissue-engineered membrane with standardized properties. Objectives: A mixed flow blood pump with an outer casing diameter of 9 mm is proposed as part of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. The usage of a blood pump deals with major challenges in the design of an intravenous device, specifically overcoming the pressure drop and enabling a controllable blood flow. This study presents the design, manufacturing, experimental and numerical investigation of the pump prototype. Methods: The pump prototype was manufactured using a Kudo3D Titan 1 (Kudo3D Inc. Dublin, USA) 3D printer, utilizing liquid photo polymeric resin coupled with a digital light processing (DLP) curing process. A static test loop consisting of the pump, ultrasonic flow sensor and pressure sensors was used to obtain the pump characteristics at different rotational speeds ranging from 23000 to 32000 rpm. A water glycerol mixture with a dynamic viscosity of 3.4 mPa.s was selected as working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Results: Over the investigated range from 30 to 500 mmHg, stable characteristic curves at different rotational speeds were measured. At 27700 rpm, a flow rate of 1.4 L/min against a pressure difference of 174 mmHg was observed. CFD simulations show a good agreement of the numerically predicted and measured pump characteristics, with an average deviation of about 8 %. Discussion: The applied manufacturing process was capable to produce thin structured, complex parts down to 300 mu m wall thickness, durable enough to be used in experimental investigations up to 32000 rpm. Experimental pump characteristics show adequate performance of the proposed mixed flow pump for the intended purpose. CFD simulations accurately match the experimental pressure difference. Objectives: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique to evaluate lungs before transplantation. As a tool for experimental research, this method allows organ modification and assessment. However, the costs are high. The aim of this study was to establish a low-cost EVLP model on the one hand and to investigate the feasibility of surgical graft downsizing during EVLP on the other hand. We compared a lobectomy, a stapled wedge and a sutured wedge resection during EVLP. Methods: Pigs of 60 kg weight were used for organ harvesting. After cardiac death lungs were retrieved, flushed with Perfadex and perfused with autologous blood for 4 hours of EVLP. The circuit was assembled from an ECMO system consisting of a Deltastream DP2 pump (Medos), an Affinity Fusion oxygenator (Medtronic) and a hardshell reservoir. After 90 minutes of perfusion a lobectomy was performed. At intervals of 30 minutes, a stapled wedge resection and a sutured wedge resection were performed. Air leak and the loss of blood were measured. The function of the lung was monitored including pulmonary artery pressure and blood gas analysis. Results: 20 porcine lungs were used to establish a stable model. Another 7 lungs underwent surgical interventions. The blood loss after lobectomy (3,14 +/- 4,14 ml/min) and after stapled wedge resection (5,29 +/- 8,1 ml/min) was lower than after sutured wedge resection (33 +/- 17,36 ml/min). There was no major difference in air leak after the surgical interventions (lobectomy: 0,06 +/- 0,16 l/min vs. stapler: 0,03 +/- 0,09 l/min vs. suture: 0,04 +/- 0,1 l/min). The oxygenation performance was satisfactory. The pulmonary artery pressure was in a physiological range. Bleeding into the parenchyma after suture was higher compared to the other interventions. Discussion: The low-cost custom-made EVLP model presented here is feasible and stable. Surgical interventions during EVLP are possible. Performing a lobectomy and a wedge resection is superior to a wedge resection with suture regarding to the blood loss. Objectives: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) possess an exceptional differentiation potential, as they are able to differentiate towards cells from all three germ layers. Owing to this capability, they are an attractive cell source for regenerative medicine applications and in vitro disease models. To date, coated substrates with Matrigel (R) and Geltrex (TM) have been providing promising platforms for hiPSC culture and differentiation. Besides many advantages, both substrates provide some drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation and xenogeneic origin, which pose problems in potential clinical applications. To tackle these issues, a matrigel-mimetic synthetic biomaterial able to maintain hiPSCs in culture is required. Cell behavior is controlled by a complex set of biophysical (e.g. stiffness) as well as biological (e.g. growth factors) parameters. In this study, we want to develop a fully synthetic hiPSC-supporting hydrogel that allows investigating the influence of biophysical and biological parameters on hiPSCs. Methods: The substrates were prepared via crosslinking starPEG and heparin molecules with different molar ratios. Substrates were biofunctionalized with two methods based on NHS ester binding to amine groups of laminins in different ratios. hiPSCs were seeded on substrates and the medium was changed every day. Cells were stained after 72 hours for pluripotency markers (OCT4-SSEA4). Results: Functionalized substrates with storage modulus of 4kPa maintained hiPSCs culture. On the other hand, no adherent cells were observed on the substrates with a storage modulus of 1kPa and 10kPa. Discussion: StarPEG-heparin hydrogels functionalized with laminin mixtures clearly represented an appropriate matrigel-mimetic growth substrate for the hiPSC culture and maintenance of their pluripotency. 3D cultures have already been shown to be superior to 2D and it is an outlook of this work. Objectives: Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular iodinated contrast media are being widely applied for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and represent one of the main causes of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).In this hospital-based study we tried to assess predictors for the development of CIN in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Methods: A total of 5604 patients undergoing coronary angiogram/PCI from 2007-2017 were enrolled in the study. Multivariate predictors of CIN were identified by logistic regression using stepwise selection with entry and exit criteria of p < 0.1. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was constructed around the point estimate of the odds (OR). A p value Results: CIN occurred in 6 (1 parts per thousand) patients. The mean age of patients suffering from CIN was higher than in the whole population (66.5 +/- 31.15 vs. 58.66 +/- 28.57, p=0.03). Characteristics of patients who developed CIN were: older age, diabetes, higher creatinine and lower EF. The incidence of CIN in patients with diabetes was higher and statistically significant (84% vs. 16%, p=0.01). Emergency cases were at higher risk of developing CIN than elective patients (85% vs.15%, p=0.001), respectively. Diabetes, CKD and EF < 50% were independent predictors of CIN (RR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.88 - 7.132, p=0.008; RR 3.1, 95% CI: 2.17 - 6.682, p=0.003; RR 1.6, 95% CI: 2.88 - 7.132, p=0.01, respectively). Discussion: The development of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent angiography and PCI was mainly related to older age, diabetes, lower GFR and heart failure, but not contrast material exposure. Objectives: To examine the efficacy of the short-time total liquid ventilation (TLV) with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline for severe and lethal respiratory failure (experiment 1 and 2, respectively) induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: In experiment 1, fifteen rats were divided into three groups: LPS+TLV group (treatment group) received 5-min TLV 20 min after LPS (5 mg/kg) administration, LPS+MGV group received 5-min mechanical gas ventilation (MGV) after the LPS administration, and PBS+MGV group received 5-min MGV 20 min after administration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead of LPS. Ventilation weaning was performed after respiratory management for three hours. At two days after each treatment, hemodynamics and blood gas parameters were measured and the rats were subsequently sacrificed. The excised lungs were used for histological analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In experiment 2, ten rats were divided into two groups: LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group. Ten mg/kg LPS was used for inducing lethal acute lung injury and the survival rate was used for the primary outcome. Results: In experiment 1, significant differences were confirmed between LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group in the value of blood oxygen, weight loss ratio, and inflammatory cytokines levels in BAL-fluid (p < 0.05). On the other hand, there was a significant difference only in arterial oxygen pressure between LPS+TLV group and PBS+MGV group. Severe inflammation in LPS+MGV group was also confirmed in the histological analysis. In experiment 2, all rats in LPS+MGV group died within two days, whereas 80% of the rats in LPS+TLV group survived for one week. Moreover, the conditions of the survival rats showed normal in the pulmonary function and the alveolar structure after one week. Discussion: It is indicated that 5-min TLV with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline after LPS administration prevented severe respiratory failure and improved the survival rate dramatically without any disorders. Objectives: Natural biological tissues have electrical conductivities and it is required that artificial tissues also possessed such a property. We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Methods: We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The aqueous dispersion contained 25 wt.% BSA, 0.45 wt.% SWCNT. Dispersion on silicon substrates was applied by screen printing. After drying, the formed layers had approximate sizes: area - 5'20 mm2, thickness - 5 15mm. For all samples the dependence of s on temperature t was recorded when they were in a thermostat. The s(t) curves were taken with a numerous cycle n = 1 5 with increasing and decreasing temperatures in the region of t 20 45 degrees C. Results: The following data was obtained. With increasing n, the values of s and the hysteresis on s(t) decreased: at n = 1 - s 0.11 S/m, temperature resistance coefficient a -0.004 K-1, hysteresis on s(t), i.e. R/R0 0.90, where R0 is the initial resistance, R is the final resistance; at n = 5 - s 36 S/m, a -0.002 K-1, R/R0 0.95. Spectral studies in the optical range did not reveal any changes in the sample before and after a cyclic thermal action, which underlines the stability of BSA. Thus, in the layers of the BSA/SWCNT the s increases and the hysteresis on s(t) decreases with n = 1 5. Apparently, this behavior is associated with an increase in the number of contacts between nanotubes in the albumin matrix. Discussion: The studied layers of the composite bionanomaterial (BSA/SWCNT) has an acceptable value of specific conductivity (1,10 S/m) and mechanical properties (hardness 300 MPa) and is promising for biomedical applications. Objectives: Determine the outcomes and survival of patients who receive a temporary total artificial heart (TAH) as bridge to transplant or as bridge to decision by evaluating data from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database in the U.S. Methods: Review of the INTERMACS database between 2006 and April 2017 revealed a total of 450 patients had been implanted. The data was reviewed to determine survival rates, adverse events, and competing outcomes. Risk factors for mortality were determined using hazard function analysis. Results: Data from 450 patients (87% men; mean age, 50 years) were available in the INTERMACS database. The 2 most common diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy (50%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (20%). Risk factors for right heart failure were present in 82% of patients. Most patients were INTERMACS Profile 1 (43%) or 2 (37%) at implantation. There were 266 patients who eventually underwent transplantation, and 162 died. Overall 3-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial survival rates were 73%, 62%, and 53%, respectively. Risk factors for death included older age (p = 0.001), need for pre-implantation dialysis (p = 0.006), higher creatinine (p = 0.008) and lower albumin (p < 0.001) levels, and implantation at a low-volume center (<= 10 TAHs; p < 0.001). Competing-outcomes analysis showed 71% of patients in high-volume centers were alive on the device or had undergone transplantation at 12 months after TAH implantation vs 57% in low-volume centers (p = 0.003). Discussion: Patients receiving TAHs have rapidly declining cardiac function and require prompt intervention. Experienced centers have better outcomes, likely related to patient selection, timing of implantation, patient care, and device management. Organized transfer of knowledge to low-volume centers could improve outcomes Objectives: To analyze the hemodynamic effect of ventricular assist devices using a multi-scale mathematical model of the human extracellular fluid system. Methods: A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) model has been incorporated into the Digital Avatar, a multi-scale, closed-loop mathematical model of the human fluid system is composed of a network of major arteries, major veins, and lumped parameter models for the heart, pulmonary circulation, arterioles, capillaries, venules, cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid. The mathematical model relies on one-dimensional PDEs for blood vessels and on ODEs for lumped parameter models. Results: Based on the model, we have quantified the hemodynamics of the systemic circulation with and without the medical device in healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Results will be shown at the conference. Discussion: Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies and clinical trials are used as the main source of evidence for getting medical devices on the market in the US. The associated costs and time are enormous and represent a burden for MedTech companies. In addition, the FDA wants to minimize animal and human study testing. In recent years, Computational Modelling and Simulation (CM&S) has made huge steps forward. CM&S are a valuable regulatory tool for its significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use and quantifying the safety and efficacy of medical devices. However, the existing CM&S tools are highly specialized for each field and do not provide a platform that integrates all human body mechanisms. Computational Life's vision is to replicate all body mechanisms into a single, integrated software called Digital Avatar platform. The Digital Avatar platform will enable MedTech companies to perform feasibility testing and quantify the safety and the efficacy of (ideally) any type of medical device. Here we will show an application with the VAD system. Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultivation systems have gained increased attention, since using these systems allows the precise study of mammalian cell physiology, intercellular interaction, as well as cell-matrix interactions. Another important cell culture parameter, often neglected in traditional cultivation, is the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Generally, cell culture is performed under ambient oxygen saturation (21%), while the oxygen amount available in vivo in human tissue is much lower (1% to 15%). The stiffness of in vivo tissues and in vitro constructs also plays a crucial role in cell fate and physiology. Methods: Semi-synthetic hydrogels with tunable properties allow creating a wide range of in vitro material stiffness. The development of hydrogel-based 3D cell culture gradient systems enables to obtain complex, but precisely defined in vitro microenvironments, which in turn allow a systematic investigation of the influence of microenvironmental conditions. Oxygen gradients in 3D and 2D cell culture can be created with the help of incubation chambers. Results: Encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells containing fluorescent hypoxia sensors reveals specific conditions where the hypoxic response is activated and determines the influence of hydrogel stiffness on the hypoxic response. In the presented study, exact correlations between in situ O2 concentrations in 3D cell cultures (hydrogels and microtissues) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation are disclosed for the first time. Discussion: Creating stable in vitro oxygen gradients in 3D hydrogel-based cultures with stiffness variety helps to better understand and predict cell behavior (survival, cytokine expression, spontaneous differentiation of stem cells or migration capacity) in physiological and pathological in vivo conditions, as well as to find optimal conditions to simulate the in vivo cell niche. Objectives: Most breast and prostate cancers metastasize to the bone. To establish macrometastases, the disseminated tumor cells (DTC) need to have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation into other tumor cells. They compete with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) for their specific microenvironment or 'niches'. Apart from biochemical factors in niches, biophysical cues also influence such interactions. The aim of this project is to investigate the intercellular crosstalk that occurs among these cells and the signalling pathways in a 3D porous hydrogel that was previously established in our group. Methods: The hydrogel mimics in structure the trabecular region of the bone marrow. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will be investigated using fluorescence imaging techniques. The pathways will be analyzed with the help of Western blots and specific inhibitors. Cytokine array and ELISA will be used for assessing auto- and paracrine communication via soluble factors. The biophysical parameters such as the 3D architecture and mechanical properties will also be tuned and their effect studied. Results: The coculture of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with bone marrow-derived MSCs and the leukemic cell line KG-1a reveal formation of spheroid-like structures in the gels. Experiments are being performed to study the cell-cell interactions within these structures. Parallel experiments are being carried out regarding the effect of the 3D architecture, which will be introduced by varying the porosity of the gel. Discussion: The results of these studies will help us to develop in vitro models of different tumor cell niches that will allow us in gaining a fundamental insight into the early events of bone metastasis. Tuning these parameters in the 3D bone marrow analog, we can have an understanding about how the biophysical cues affect the cellular activities. Objectives: Bioartificial liver devices aim to replace the detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver in people with liver failure. Shear stress and local velocities created by flow inside porous scaffolds need to be optimised to improve cell viability and avoid inflammation, however there are no relevant studies on the topic to date. Here, fluid dynamics inside porous cryogels were characterised using a purpose-built micro-PIV system. The aims were to develop a micro-PIV setup to record the flow inside cryogel structure and to characterise the nature of flow inside the cryogel channels by video post-processing in order to determine inlet design. Methods: HEMA- based cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique and the microstructure was analysed by SEM, confocal microscope and mu CT. Open porosity, overall porosity and permeability were extrapolated from mu CT. A mu PIV set up was developed to visualise flow inside cryogels which was composed of a digital camera with a long-distance microscope objective, a pulsating LED light source, a pump and an optical chamber to host the cryogel. Glass beads of 10 mu m size were used as tracers to mimic red blood cells. Videos were analysed with PIVlab in Matlab which allowed the interpolation of local velocities. Results: Cryogels possessed an open porosity, with pore size up to 100 mu m, as well as an interconnected network of pores, making it suitable for a perfused system. Fluid dynamics were optimized using a mu PIV setup which allows for the visualisation of flow inside the cryogel channels. Discussion: Videos showed that internal flow did not reorganize itself through the channels and was found to be laminar with Re < 1 with low vorticity. This suggests that molecules and toxins of the blood in the centre of a channel would not interact with hepatocytes seeded on the cryogel pore walls. Hence, flow reorganization could be promoted through a layered bioreactor. A layered cryogel structure was introduced to improve flow characteristics and improve toxin/hepatocyte interaction. Objectives: Generation of a large-scale stem cell derived bioartificial cardiac tissue (BCT) as a potential therapeutic option to replace damaged myocardium after myocardial infarction. Methods: Large-scale BCT was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) mixed with human fibroblasts and a hydrogel solution in a newly designed tissue chamber with a diameter of 43 mm. The BCT development was microscopically recorded and evaluated. Maturation of CMs within the tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for cardiac markers (alpha-SA, cTnT) as well as cell junction proteins (Con. 43, N-Cad). The integration of the tissue chamber in the novel custom-made bioreactor allowed investigating the initial parameters for electromechanical stimulation (such as pressure, stress amplitude, frequency) necessary for proper tissue maturation in a more physiological manner. To investigate the calcium handling through the tissue a new transgenic hiPSC line containing a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) has been developed. Results: Microscopically evaluation at different time points reveals a progressive reduction of nearly 27% of the initial volume after 15 days, ccorresponding with an increased intercellular connectivity. After 48h, the tissue exhibited spontaneous contractions and coordinated and rhythmic contraction within the whole tissue after 6 days. As preliminary analysis, the beating of the tissue was video-optically recorded showing an estimated beating rate of 102 beats per minute. Immunofluorescence staining performed at day 15 showed highly organised cross-striations of sarcomere proteins. Initial integration of the tissue chamber in the bioreactor and implementation of the new GCaMP6f reporter cell line is still on-going. Discussion: The initial results confirmed that is possible to generate a large-scale BCT. However, the properties of the tissue have to be further investigated. Objectives: The Fontan procedure is performed for univentricular correction of the heart in pediatric patients with tricuspid atresia. In the Fontan circulation, the veins connect directly to the pulmonary artery. However, as a result of the procedure the load on the single functional ventricle of the heart and veins increases. Eventually, patients need a heart transplantation. A possible solution to the circulation deficiencies of the Fontan patients could be the ventricular assist device (VAD). The VAD is implanted between veins and the pulmonary artery. The aim of this study is to develop a model of the Fontan circulation with VAD support. Methods: We use mathematical models to reduce the time and resources spent on in vivo research. Nonlinear mathematical models represent sections of the cardiovascular system (CVS) in the form of blocks. Pressure variations in the CVS sections are described by a system of differential equations. Results: Appling VAD to the Fontan patients exhibits the potential to increase the venous return of blood. According to the Frank-Starling law, the stroke volume increases with increasing venous return. VAD creates a necessary pressure differential between the venous and pulmonary sections of CVS. Discussion: The interaction model of the Fontan circulation with VAD support demonstrates the normalization of the pressure and volume distribution in the CVS. This indicates that the method studied in this work may be a way to optimize the health condition of patients after Fontan procedure. Objectives: Autologous pericardium is one of the most ideal materials for cardiovascular reconstruction including pulmonary arteries and valvular cusps especially in pediatric patients. To improve the surgical handling, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) have been commonly attempted. In this study, we compared the effects of such chemical treatments with short period (10 min) on the mechanical properties of the porcine pericardium. Methods: Porcine pericardium (n=3) was separated into 3 groups, raw group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with 70% ET for10 min (ET) and crosslinking with 0.6% GA for 10 min (GA). We measured 5 parameters of mechanical properties: the burst pressure, suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate strain (%) and stimulus modulus. Results: Minimal burst pressure of RAW group, ET group and GA group were 12160 mmHg, 10640 mmHg, and 8360 mmHg, respectively, all of which were high enough for cardiovascular substitutes. There were no significant differences in suture retention strength (RAW: 3.242 +/- 0.261 N, ET: 3.298 +/- 0.214 N, GA: 2.985 +/- 0.165 N, p=0.529), UTS (RAW: 18.238 +/- 1.987 MPa, ET: 19.104 +/- 2.234 MPa, GA: 16.059 +/- 1.233 MPa, p=0.486) or Young's modulus (RAW: 4.964 +/- 0.551 MPa, ET: 4.544 +/- 0.719 MPa, GA: 3.921 +/- 0.288 MPa, p=0.408). Only the ultimate strain of GA group was significantly higher between the 3 groups (RAW: 35.64 +/- 2.82 %, ET: 37.99 +/- 2.38 %, GA: 46.39 +/- 3.96 %, p=0.046). Discussion: Short period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to improve the surgical handling without deteriorating the mechanical properties of pericardium. Engineering modelling and simulation have been being used in different industries for better product and process development for already many decades. Together with the developments in medical imaging, this engineering approach can now be applied to understand how different human organs function and eventually develop devices to replace them or support their correct functioning. A digital environment for development of artificial organs and medical devices is possible with correct application of engineering modelling and simulation. These concepts enable researchers and engineers to perform design iterations rapidly and with ease. This is why the application of engineering modelling and simulation is considered as one of the very important bio-technological advancements in the recent years and is projected to be so in the close future. In this respect; cardiology is one of the areas where this potential is being converted to valuable outputs. Virtual modelling and analysis of a representative beating human heart, patient specific heart modelling or digital prototypes of heart devices are main research interests of an interdisciplinary community of cardiologists, surgeons, engineers, and physicians. In the scope of cardiovascular simulations; patient specific (or normalized among a group of patients) medical imaging based CFD simulations and coupled multiphysics FSI simulations are the main approaches for generating the simulation frameworks moving forward in the road to ultimate digital twins of the human heart. This presentation is intended to give insights about various processes that lead to higher fidelity digital representations in the scope of cardiovascular simulations, including below: - CFD model generation based on CT scans - Non-invasive digital angiography & FFR CT (Fractional Flow Reserve) - Post-TAVI coronary flow - Blood flow in SIMULIA LHHM (Living Heart Human Model) with mechanical valves - Transcatheter tissue engineered aortic valve FSI simulation - Evolut R stent deployment in LHHM - Mitral Valve and Mitral Clip FSI simulation The presentation intends to give a brief introduction on the simulation concepts/approaches which can be applied to cardiovascular problems. While it intends to encourage the community to take the advantage of these concepts in cardiovascular research, it highlights the importance of correct modelling and accurate numerical simulations. Objectives: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is the most commonly used ventricular assist device in children. Pump thrombosis is a major complication of the system and is most likely to occur in smaller pumps used for children under the age of 2. Pump exchange is seen as the therapeutic gold standard, but is associated with high mortality if in- or outflow cannulas are affected and therefor have to be changed surgically. Methods: Herein we report our experience in the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (Alteplase, Actilyse (R)) for the therapy of an acute pump thrombosis subtotally occluding the inflow cannula of a 7 month old girl supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD. The infant was supported by LVAD therapy used for acute left ventricular failure due to fulminant myocarditis, and the system was implanted 20 days prior to when the thrombotic event was reported. A treatment protocol of 1.2mg/kg - initial bolus application of 0.12mg/kg/2mins - of Alteplase infusion given continuously for 120mins was used, and the assist device was connected to a Maquet Quadrox-I neonatal and pediatric oxygenator to obviate thrombembolic complications. Results: The infant supported by Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD was haemodynamically stable prior to the thrombotic event, and anticoagulation was performed with a continuous heparin infusion. Within a couple of hours, she became tachycardic and developed signs of low cardiac output, and a subtotal occlusion of the inflow cannula of the Berlin Heart System was diagnosed. As surgery was felt to be highly problematic, we decided to infuse Alteplase and achieved short-term success with resolution of the pump thrombosis within 2 hours. There was no adverse event. Discussion: Tissue-type plasminogen activator thrombolysis might be an effective treatment for Berlin Heart EXCOR thrombosis in haemodynamically compromised children. Additionally, the use of a Maquet Quadrox-I oxygenator might minimize the risk of major complications (i.e. thromboembolism) that have been reported in the literature. Drug discovery and development to date has relied on animal models, which are useful, but fail to resemble human physiology. The discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of drug screening using human patient- and disease-specific organ/tissue-models. One promising approach to generate these models is by combining the hiPSC technology with microfluidic devices tailored to create microphysiological environments. Such organ-on-a-chip platforms (OoCs) or microphysiological systems combine human genetic background, in vivo-like tissue structure, physiological functionality, and \"vasculature-like\" perfusion. Using microfabrication techniques, we have developed a variety of OoCs that incorporate complex human 3D tissues, such as retinal, choroidal, cardiac, pancreatic, and adipose tissue. By generating microphysiological environments the platform is capable of keeping the tissues viable and functional over multiple weeks. The OoCs generally consist of three functional components: organ-specific tissue chambers mimicking in vivo structure and microenvironment of the respective tissues; \"vasculature-like\" media channels enabling a precise and computationally predictable delivery of soluble compounds (nutrients, drugs, hormones); \"endothelial-like\" barriers protecting the tissues from shear forces while allowing diffusive transport. The small scale and accessibility for in situ analysis makes our OoCs amenable for both massive parallelization and integration into a high-content-screening approach. To facilitate and enable the adoption of OoCs in industrial and non-specialized laboratories, we have developed technologies for automated 3D tissue generation and for the flexible plug&play connection of individual modules to multi-organ-chips. These technologies paired with the versatility of our OoCs pave the way for applications in drug development, personalized medicine, toxicity screening, and mechanistic research. Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, USA) is a new compact LVAD which is associated with several new technical features (e.g. fully magnetically levitated pump, artificial pulse, large pump gaps, modular driveline, etc.). These benefits are supposed to lead to superior outcomes and reduced adverse events as compared to its predecessor HeartMate II (HMII; Abbott, USA) and other comparable assist devices. With this study, we investigated the effect of HM3 implantation on the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings compared to other LVADs. Methods: We retrospectively studied a patient cohort of 595 patients who were supported with left ventricular assist devices. 170 Patients were supported by HMII, 81 Patients were supported by HM3 and 344 Patients were supported by HVAD (HeartWare, Medtronic, USA). Data was determined through retrospective examination of medical records. Exclusion criteria were biventricular assist devices and other types of assist devices as well as LVAD exchange and re-operative procedures. Results: Out of 595 patients 146 patients (24.4%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding after LVAD implantation. In the multivariate analysis GI bleeding was significantly dependent on age but not on the BMI or gender of the patient. Statistically we were able to show that the occurrence of GI bleedings is significantly connected to general bleedings but not to cerebral hemorrhages. The subgroup analysis revealed that the occurrence of GI bleedings was higher in the HVAD (26%) and HMII (26%) groups compared to the HM3 patients (14%). However, statistical significance could not be achieved. Discussion: The novel HeartMate 3 shows a promising adverse event profile with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal bleedings compared to its competitors. However statistical significance could not be achieved in this study. Thus, larger multi-center cohort analyses are needed. Objectives: In medical practice, it is necessary to control the movements of various parts of the body: limbs, joints, chest, tumors, etc. For such purposes, the most suitable are the composite bionanomaterials in the composition of carbon nanotubes. We investigated the strain sensor (tensoresistor) based on the layers of the bionanomaterial contained biological material (bovine serum albumin, BSA - matrix) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT - filler). Methods: The aqueous dispersion of 25 wt.% BSA/0.3 wt.% MWCNT was applied by screen printing on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. After drying layers by laser irradiation ( 970 nm) various parameters of layers were controlled, i.e. resistance R, bending angle q, number of cycles n, measurement time, etc. One measurement cycle corresponded to a change within the range q >>+/- 150 degrees. Results: The slopes of Sq = (1/R0)dR/dq of the R(q) curves were considered to be strain-sensitivities, where R0 is the resistance of the sensor with q=0. It was found that with increasing the number n, R and Sq increase and the hysteresis on R(q) decreases. For the tensoresistor obtained: specific resistances 0.1 divided by 1 Wxm, Sq1.0 divided by 1.5%/grad. These results are high. Discussion: The physical picture of the change in the R(q) is as follows. When q>0, compression occurs, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes increases and the resistance drops relative to the state q=0. When q<0, the nanotubes move away from each other, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes decreases and the resistance increases relative to the state q=0. The examined layers of the bionanomaterial BSA/MWCNT as a strain sensor is of a particular interest for medical practice. In particular, for monitoring: movements (arms, blinking) and detection of signs of pathology (respiratory diseases, angina, et. al.). The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is applicable on 26th May 2020. Then the current Medical Device Directive(MDD) and its national transpositions like the current German Medical Device Act (Medizinproduktegesetz) will be replaced by the new rules. Further transitions periods for existing certificates will not help for devices of the lowest risk class and will not free parties from taking into consideration the new rules for handling of device problems or registration. The new certification of existing devices in time will be challenging, because the accreditation and notification of notified bodies in accordance with the new requirements, which are needed for certification of higher risk class medical devices, is ongoing very slowly. The new European database is still not gone live, but the device and economic operator registration is dependent on the functioning of that database. A strong focus of the new regulation is on clinical evaluation of medical devices, which will leave manufacturers and developers probably with open questions. For example, what extend of clinical data is sufficient for keeping an existing device on the market? The presentation will highlight several obvious or less obvious changes due to the new regulation. It will provide guidance where to find additional answers for specific questions. And it will give an outlook on upcoming additional legislation and guidance. Objectives: Exercise capacity in patients with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is 50% compared to healthy subjects. Some patients show a better performance than others. Aim of this work is to investigate the factors responsible of this inter-subject variability. Methods: A cardiorespiratory simulator (CRS) was developed and combined with a model of the HVAD running at 2700 rpm to reproduce an \"average\" LVAD patients hemodynamic at rest and at exercise. The CRS was validated using the average hemodynamic data of >200 LVAD patients from the literature. Starting from this \"average\" LVAD profile, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a left/right ventricular contractility (Elmax/Ermax) and heat rate (HR) 20% higher than value usually observed at exercise. Results: The simulated \"average\" LVAD profile at rest is in full support with a total cardiac output (CO) of 4.8 l/min and a wedge pressure (Pw) of 13 mmHg. At exercise Pw increases to 26 mmHg and CO increases to 6.8 l/min, of which 5.3 l/min pumped by the LVAD (QLVAD) and 1.5 l/min by the ventricle (QLV). An increased Elmax at exercise assures lower Pw (22 mmHg) and higher CO (7.4 l/min) due to a better contribution of the ventricle (QVAD=4.7 l/min, QLV=2.7 l/min). An improved HR also helps to sustain a better CO (7.1 l/min) as a combined effect of both pumps (QVAD= 5.4 l/min, QLV=1.7 l/min). A better Emaxr induces a smaller improvement in CO (7.0 l/min) due to the increased LVAD support (QVAD=5.5 l/min, QLV=1.5 l/min), however Pw reaches 31 mmHg. Discussion: A better left ventricular inotropic response is mostly effective in accommodating a higher CO at exercise. A better right ventricular function has mild effects on CO and can increase Pw if not sustained by a good ejection on the left side. These results should be taken into account for the design of a physiological LVAD speed controller, tailored on specific patient's needs. The electro-hydraulically actuated Carmat total artificial heart (C-TAH) is designed for biventricular replacement in patients suffering from end-stage heart failure, either as bridge to transplant or destination therapy. It generates pulsatile flow which is automatically adapted to the patient's physiological needs. The device contains bio-prosthetic blood contacting materials, allowing for low dose anti-coagulation. A multi-centre European study is currently underway to assess the safety and performance of the C-TAH, with 6-months survival as primary objective. Preliminary results will be presented from a cohort of 10 patients included in the study. Objectives: The mechano-biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in 2D and 3D cultures is determined by formation of actin filaments which occur as branched stress fibers. For clinical-scale expansion of functional MSCs, the use of xeno-based serum products is prohibited, but human platelet lysate (HPL) can potentially replace fetal bovine serum. Here we investigate actin filament formation and mitochondrial morphology in the 2D and 3D MSC culture supplemented with HPL and analyzed immunomodulatory molecules GARP, Foxp3 and IDO following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Methods: Human platelet lysate composition was determined with a proteome profiler assay. Amnion derived MSCs were cultured in HPL supplemented media and MSC morphology was analyzed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Mechano-biological properties of cultured MSCs were performed by atomic force microscopy. Results: The occurrence of actin filaments in 2D MSCs cultivated in HPL supplemented media was decreased as compared to conventional growth media, where the number of ventral stress fibers, anchored at each end by focal adhesions, was affected and influenced membrane elasticity. Dorsal stress fibers or transverse arcs were not affected. Mitochondrial network dynamics in HPL cultivated MSCs showed a perinuclear accumulation. 3D cultivation of MSCs was less sensitive to media supplementation. Functional activity of GARP was found non-stimulated MSCs while expression of Foxp3 and IDO relied on pro-inflammatory stimuli. Discussion: In conclusion we can say that mechano-biological capabilities of MSCs cultivated in 2D and 3D rely on stress fibers, mitochondrial distribution and certain bioactive molecules such as GARP, Foxp3 and IDO. HPL supplementation leads to downregulation of f-actin filament formation as well as conserved membrane elasticity. Objectives: Modern research in cryobiology requires a deeper understanding of the influence of different factors on the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. One of these factors is ice crystallization which has a tremendous impact on the surveillance and quality of live objects during freezing, long term storage, and thawing. Analysis of this process requires software which should be able to obtain quantitative parameters of crystals in a human-like manner with acceptable processing speed. The purpose of this work is to consider the possibility of using the multiscale image representation for the quantitative analysis of ice crystals. Methods: In our research, we used microscopic images of ice crystals during crystals formation and thawing. In previous studies for the segmentation of ice crystals on the image, we used different approaches such as active contour. At the same time, it should be noticed that the speed of active contour expansion is low and thus time-consuming to process large time sequence. Thus, we suggest the application of a Gaussian Pyramid. This multiscale representation allows analysis at a low scale and improves at a high scale. Results: We have analyzed multiple images using the proposed approach. The results in the first approximation show a 2-fold increase in speed when using our implementation of active contours. At the same time, the segmented areas of crystals correspond to the approach without the use of multi-scale image representation. Discussion: The results of this work show that multiscale image representation can be applied to improve the speed and applicability of modern software for automated image analysis. The next steps will include applicability evaluation of multiscale representation for different cases as well as the development of software realizing vector processor architecture. Objectives: One of the objectives of hemodialysis (HD) is preserving optimal acid-base homeostasis. Bicarbonate is an obligatory component of dialysis fluids in order to titrate the acidic products of protein metabolism that accumulate between treatments. Even though bicarbonate can easily transfer across HD membranes, its plasma concentration does not equilibrate with that in dialysis fluid by the end of the treatment, for reasons unclear. We used a mathematical model to test whether an intradialytic increase in total non-bicarbonate buffer concentration in plasma (tNBBp) could explain this lack of equilibrium. Methods: We modified the model of CO2 and bicarbonate whole body transport proposed in 1995 by Rees and Andreassen, adding bicarbonate transfer from dialysis fluid to plasma via a dialyzer connected to an arteriovenous fistula. The model described the transport of O2, CO2, and base excess between different compartments: arterial and venous circulations, interstitial fluid and lung capillaries. In each compartment, equations describing the biochemistry of blood were solved to estimate the components of bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffer systems. Results: The model qualitatively described the typical intradialytic pattern of bicarbonate concentration, pH, base excess, CO2 and O2 partial pressures observed in patients under routine thrice weekly HD. Model predictions were compared assuming a constant or increasing tNBBp during HD. When tNBBp was allowed to increase, the intradialytic increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration was blunted and the model predictions better fit published time-dependent intradialytic plasma bicarbonate concentrations. Discussion: It was suggested in literature that HD treatment may stimulate an increased concentration of non-bicarbonate buffers and release of hydrogen ions from these organic acids. Our preliminary modeling results are consistent with this hypothesis and show that the model is capable of predicting the effect of the HD treatment on the buffer systems of the body. Objectives: To develop an implant for the bone-tendon transition, it is our approach to optimize polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by coating for a functionalization with drug release systems. The procedure during the functionalization should enable a release of growth factors in a spatially and temporally graded way. Methods: The PCL fiber mats were prepared by electrospinning. Polydopamine (pDA)-based coatings were used to modify the surface of the fibers. To get thin polymeric, hydrophilic and biocompatible coatings we applied the pure pDA system and a co-deposition with amines (ethylenediamine (ED), hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)). To functionalize our system with growth factors we used chitosan-based nanoparticles which can be loaded with the therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and TGF-beta. By a defined dipping procedure we generate fiber mats with a graded functionalization. Results: The measurement of the contact angle and the surface zeta potential showed a change from a hydrophobic PCL surface to a highly hydrophilic and amphoteric character for the coated systems. The charged surface enables the further functionalization with loaded nanoparticles. The release of BMP2 and TGF-beta from the functionalized scaffolds was established. With a dipping procedure we are able to functionalize our scaffolds in a graded way. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluorescence-labeled NP showed that we could generate up to three differently functionalized regions. Discussion: The results show the methodology is suited to prepare implants, which can release growth factors in a spatially and temporally controlled way. These graded implants can be used for in-situ tissue engineering. Objectives: Solute movement from blood to dialysis solution is largely determined by transmembrane pressure (TMP). Accordingly, it was imperative to develop a TMP control system that allows for the maintanence of constant pressure. TMP in dialyzer is one of the tasks in wearable artificial kidney development. In most of the known devices, transmembrane pressure is regulated only by adjusting the flow-pressure characteristics of the pump or mechanical uncontrolled clamping line. Methods: A system was proposed which consists of a pinch valve, a DC motor and a control circuit. This device allows you to automatically adjust the pressure. At first, the device reads data from the differential sensor, which measures the TMP. After that, the position of the moving part of the pinch valve changes and the degree of clamping of the line changes, which in turn affects the value of TMP. The case of the device was made using a 3D printer. A test bench was created in order to determine the effectiveness of maintaining a constant TMP. It consists of five parts: two circuits with two peristaltic pumps, a dialyzer, a differential pressure sensor and a power source. The pressure from the primary circuit was varied by manually clamping the line and the degree of pressure differential compensation by the pinch valve was determined. Results: The experiment showed that the TMP changes are fully compensated by the pinch valve. Accuracy of the developed device depends largely on accuracy of pressure measurement sensor. There was no change in the flow rate of the fluid, and this is important, because the rate of dialysate regeneration depends on the flow rate of the fluid. Discussion: The experiment showed that this device can be used to control TMP. Accuracy of the system allows you to use it in the wearable artificial kidney. Objectives: This paper describes the testing methods used in the development of software for an implantable heart monitor. It is a complex medical system. To identify errors made while writing software, as well as to detect deviations in the operation of the device in a timely manner, it is necessary to constantly carry out testing of all elements of the system. Methods: Testing methods used in the development of an implantable heart monitor: - debugging using JTAG, - self-test system, - testing via COM port, - recording test information in the device's internal memory (data logging), - interprocessor testing. Consider some of them in more detail. Debugging and testing using JTAG: Due to the fact that the development was carried out in Code Composer environment, this allowed the use of a special script language GEL (General Extension Language). This is an expression language used by the CCS debugger. Launch GEL files are used to automate software development. GEL is an interpreted language, and its syntax is the same as C. Thereby it is possible to carry out tests, and change them, or add new ones in the process of the main software. Logging: One of the testing methods is to track changes in the state of the system over time. One way is to write data to the device's internal memory. But in such a way that you can track at what point in time the change occurred. For this you can use time stamps. If the data is recorded strictly with a certain frequency, you can do without time stamps. Results: The presented test methods differ in that some of them can be used only in the early stages of development and some even when the device is at the end user. Discussion: Cardiovascular diseases are very dangerous and difficult to diagnose. Early diagnosis and prediction of these diseases can lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients. Objectives: To clarify the reasons, beneficial effects and duration of AVF patency after radiological interventions in AVF stenosis. Methods: In 174 patients, 522 radiological investigations and endovascular treatments such as percutaneous trans luminal angioplasty (PTA) were analyzed, retrospectively. All investigations were performed due to clinical suspicion of impaired AVF function. Results: Arterial stenosis was significantly more frequent among patients with diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001) and interstitial nephritis (p < 0.001). According to the venous stenosis, the diagnosis did not affect the frequency (p=0.22), neither the degree of the stenosis (p=0.39). The degree of stenosis prior to PTA correlated significantly with the degree of remaining stenosis after intervention (p<0.001). Of the 174 patients, 123 (71%) performed a total of 318 PTA investigations. Repeated PTA was performed significantly more often in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The median times to first PTA and to the subsequent PTAs were 9.5 months and 5 months, respectively. Discussion: Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at a greater risk of getting recurrent stenosis; this motivates a closer follow up for these patients. Clinically significant stenosis should be dilated as meticulously and as soon as possible. Occlusions of the AVF in most instances can be successfully thrombolyzed or dilated upon early diagnosis. Objectives: Designing new ventricular assist devices to coupe two major challenges in the field: less invasive intervention and reducing side effects was our objective. Methods: Computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamics were performed with Solidworks 2017 to design and test several new bearingless centrifugal ventricular assist devices. Fused deposition modeling was used to build the models and subcutaneous implantation was simulated and transcutaneous power transfer was tested. Results: Two bearingless, fully implantable ventricular assisted devices were developed. The first is a radial flux motor fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device. The second is an axial flux hydro-magnetically suspended rotor ventricular assist device. Both devices contain an internal rechargeable battery, power transfer coil, electronic circuit and have a cylindrical shape with 15-20 mm height and 100 mm diameter. The flow is 3 l/min at 135 mmHg is achieved and efficiency of power transfer of 80% with a 5 mm gap. The devices are implantable in a pectoral subcutaneous pocket with the inflow connected to left atrium and the outflow to subclavian artery in a fashion pioneered in this field by CircuLite Synergy. Discussion: Both devices came with innovations in motor and pump design that set the foundation to build the entire system in a single body low height cylindrical shape, optimal for subcutaneous implantation and by this with good transcutaneous power transfer efficiency. Objectives: For most in vitro cultivations of mammalian cells, culture medium is supplemented with serum, which contains important proteins and factors for the cell growth. Previous experiments showed already a positive effect of human platelet lysate (hPL) as a medium supplement for the two-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Since 3D culture systems gain big interest for in vitro applications and regenerative medicine, the influence of hPL on 3D cell culture models must also be investigated. Semi synthetic protein not sign based hydrogels represent a very promising 3D cell culture platform, which is biocompatible and biodegradable. Methods: In our work, gelatine-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with a various degree of functionalization were dissolved in different hPL concentrations (0 %, 2.5 %, 50 %, 100 % hPL). The Influence of hPL on proliferation and differentiation of in GelMa encapsulated MSCs were monitored and measured via viability assays, immunocytochemical stainings and microscopy. Furthermore, the influence of hPL addition on mechanical characteristics of GelMA hydrogels was examined by swelling studies and rheometric analysis. Results: The addition of hPL to GelMA hydrogels enhances the cell-spreading, the degree of differentiation as well as cell viability in concentration-depended manner. Besides, the results of the rheometric tests showed an increase of hydrogel stiffness by using higher concentrations of hPL. Discussion: Obtained results demonstrate that supplementation of hydrogels with hPL has a positive effect on cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, hPL can be a promising hydrogel stiffness enhancer for application in 3D bioprinting. Objectives: Generally, LVAD thrombosis is diagnosed only by reviewing online logfiles that show an increase of power consumption and flow of the device. In order to increase diagnostic power and improve treatment management, trans-thoracic echocardiography was carried out to assess any blood flow changes. Methods: Eight patients (M 7; F 1) experienced a total of 17 Heart Ware VAD thromboses. At echocardiogram, a 4-chamber view was obtained and the echo probe beam was aligned to blood flow of the inflow cannula. Continous-wave Doppler was applied for the assessment of: 1) the increase of flow maximal velocity (Vmax) above basal ranges over several cardiac cycles and 2) the irregular discontinous sound of the device. Online logfiles were reviewed for abnormal increase in power consumption and flow compared to basal data. All patients underwent thrombolysis with rTPA. Echocardiography results before and after treatment were compared. Results: Thrombolysis was successful in all patients; one patient died due to cerebral haemorrhage. Echocardiograms before thrombolysis showed an increased mean Vmax of 6.4 +/- 0.5 m/sec, whereas after treatment Vmax was 360 +/- 0.2 m/sec (p < 0.001). In all cases irregular, abnormal and discontinuous sounds were heard in thrombosed inflow cannulae. After thrombolysis only washing jet sounds were heard. Before thrombolysis logfiles showed a mean increase of power consumption of 5.6 +/- 0.3 watts, returning to basal values of 3.8 +/- 0.3 watts after thrombolysis (p<0.001). Before thrombolysis logfiles showed mean flow of 6.2 +/- 0.6 L/min, after treatment mean flow was back to normal ranges 4.2 +/- 0.5 L/sec (p<0.001). Discussion: Transthoracic echocardiography showed a significant increase of blood flows in the inflow cannula of thrombosed LVAD devices, confirming findings of log files review. A combined approach by logfiles review and echocardiography is recommended in patients with LVAD thrombosis. Objectives: Leukocyte activation is correlated to a reduced immune response in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. Research has displayed leukocyte microparticle (MP; 200-1000nm diameter) increases following VAD shear stress. However, questions still arise regarding MP role, impact and biogenesis. MPs are plasma membrane derived, but there are smaller (50-100nm diameter), cytoplasmic vesicles (exosomes) which are often overlooked, or mistaken for MPs. As such, unless these vesicles are successfully separated, they should be categorised as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are known to have roles in cellular communications and implications in diseases, and it is desirable to assess leukocyte sub-sets and any associated roles in VAD complications. Methods: Bovine blood was diluted to a haematocrit of 30 +/- 2% according to ASTM standards. Blood was pumped for 6 hours in vitro with the CentriMag (R) centrifugal pump (Thoratec (R) Corp., USA). Flow cytometry determined a leukocyte EV population, having eliminated cellular debris. Platelet-poor plasma was tested for vesicle size and quantity using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and immunoblotting conducted for exosome markers. Results: Flow cytometry data displayed an increase in leukocyte death in the CentriMag, correlating to an increase in leukocyte derived EV production. Further analysis determined that these vesicles were mainly monocyte derived, suggesting a potential implication in inflammation. Preliminary NTA and immunoblotting displayed increased EVs following shear, namely exosomes. Discussion: The presence of exosome marker staining and NTA size analysis displays evidence in favour of vesicle increase not being MP specific. As EVs have known implications in inflammation, infection and disease, these results suggest that exosomes may be associated with adverse events in clinical settings. Thus, exosomes should be further examined to elucidate any role as biomarkers of VAD related complications. Objectives: To investigate the influence of bone turnover markers in end-stage renal disease patients for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: 221 ESRD patients with SHPT were split into two groups according to the iPTH level: Mild SHPT group (M-group) (iPTH130 -600 pg/ml, n=86) and severe SHPT group (S-group) (iPTH > 1500pg/ml, n=53). Serum BTM such as beta- CrossLaps (ss-CTX) procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC) were detected. Results: Compared to the M-group, the patients in S-group had higher levels of the ss-CTX (5877.40 +/- 423.01 pg/ml, vs 3206.90 +/- 1438.27), P=0.000, the P1NP (1145.50 +/- 171.36 ug /ml, vs 440.00 +/- 308.12), P=0.000, the OC (258.52 +/- 48.61 ng/ml, vs 221.74 +/- 75.99 ng/ml), P=0.000. ROC Curve analysis for the main risk factors of the parathyroid hyperplasia were ss-CTX, P1NP, sALP, iPTH. Discussion: Severe SHPT had higher levels of bone turnover markers, which may have aggravated CKD-MBD. Objectives: One of the main functions of renal replacement therapy is removal of excess products of metabolism from blood. Uremic toxins, waste products found in the blood of patients in need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), have very high blood concentrations and are harmful to the organism. Uremic toxins have been found over 100 and their classification is based on their molecular mass and linkage to proteins. EUTox, the European uremic toxin work group, has divided uremic toxins into 3 groups: water soluble toxins with small molecular mass (MM) < 500 Da (e.g. urea); middle size molecules, MM > 500 Da, (e.g. beta 2-microglobulin); protein-bound uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl sulphate and rho-cresyl sulfate). Methods: TalTech and a spin-off company grown out of the university, OFT, have developed a new, real-time multicomponent (MCM)-sensor to monitor all uremic toxin groups in RRT. MCM-sensor contains miniature LED-technology to measure UV-absorbance and fluorescence. During online measurements, the sensor is connected to dialysis machine outlet with easy-to-handle connectors. Results: The results from a pilot clinical study at Nephrology Department of North Estonia Medical Centre and Nephrology Department of Linkoping University Hospital will be presented. The outputs of the sensor are on-line concentration patterns of small, middle and protein-bound uremic toxins in the waste dialysis and the clinical parameters of the uremic toxin removal (removal rate, total solute removal). A telemetry application enables to follow the dialytic removal even on remote distances. Discussion: A concept for smart real-time monitoring of intermittent RRT has been realized as a novel miniaturized optical sensor performing intradialytic on-line multicomponent uremic toxins monitoring in the spent dialysate. Objectives: Since Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) were shown to enhance neural outgrowth towards them, an approach with a CNT-Silicone rubber compound that immerses the CNTs and thus anchors them to the implant is investigated in an animal model Methods: To compare the CNT-silicone rubber to state-of-the-art neuronal implant materials, 6 variations of the same implant with varying exposed materials were fabricated. The thin-film implants consisted of a polyimide substrate and metal pathways encapsulated in silicone rubber. Depending on the batch, either metal or CNT-silicone rubber were exposed. Female mice were implanted on the brain and under the skin (flank area) for 60 or 180 days. After necropsy, the head was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde. After 24h, it was stored in 70% ethanol for another 24h and then decalcified. It was then trimmed, dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and xylene. After embedding in Technovit 8100, sections with nominal thickness of 2 mu m were cut. The same procedure was performed on the implants and skin from the flank, except they were embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mu m slices. Light microscopic examination of Hematoxylin and eosin stained slices was performed. Results: During histopathological examination, both findings associated with surgery and implant-related microscopic changes were observed in sections from the head and flank. The tissue around the implant showed similar reactions in all groups. Macrophages and inflammatory cells as well as slight fibrosis were found around the implant in all animals Discussion: Preparation of tissue sections including thin film implants was shown to be possible, yet the differences in material properties led to problems during cutting. However, usage of different embedding materials for the tissues worked. These first results suggest that the used CNT-Silicone rubber materials could be used in short term applications. Objectives: The properties of nanocomposite (NC) poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) hydrogels as well as 3D printing techniques for hydrogels have gained a lot of significance in the tissue engineering community. This study aims at the development of a stable water based ink formulation for nanocomposite hydrogels usable by DLP/SLA 3D-printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm to use them e.g. for investigations in water flows. Methods: Diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (as photo-initiator), Laponite XLG (as nanocomposite crosslinker), sodium dodecyl sulfate (as surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (as crystallization inhibitor) were dissolved in a N-butyl acetat and isopropanol solution at room temperature. This organic phase was then mixed with bi-distilled water and stirred for 20 minutes in a closed container to form a micro emulsion. The micro emulsion was flash freezed in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried in a Virtis Advantage Plus freeze drying unit for at least 24 h at -50 degrees C and 0.4 mbar. The obtained powder could be dispersed in a NIPAM/water solution to form a stable, UV-curable ink. To show the applicability of hydrogels for investigating flows around bodies in principle, experiments in a water channel will be conducted. Results: The obtained ink is suitable for the most commonly used SLA and DLP printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm. Whereas the expected curing time is much higher than the curing time of commercially available standard polymeric printing inks due to the inhibiting effect of the Laponite XLG. The applicability experiments are in preparation. Discussion: NC-hydrogels obtain through this photo-polymerization method show similar mechanical properties to the standard NC-hydrogels obtained through radical polymerization with potassium peroxodisulfate. Objectives: Laser interference lithography (LIL) and the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a system with variable nanotopographies and surface viscoelasticity to regulate cell behavior. Methods: LIL is used to generate hexagonally arranged nanostructures of gold with different periodicity. In contrast, LBL is used to assemble a multilayer system of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) on top of the nanostructures. Moreover, the viscoelastic properties of that system are controlled by chemical cross-linking. Results: We show that the topography designed with LIL is still present after multilayer deposition and that the formation of the multilayer system renders the surfaces hydrophilic, which is opposite to the hydrophobic nature of pristine nanostructures. The heterogenic system is applied to study the effect on adhesion and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC). We show that hADSC spreading is increasing with cross-linking degree on flat multilayers, while it is decreasing on nanostructures modified with multilayers. In addition, early effects on signal transduction processes are seen. Finally, hADSC differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages is superior to adipogenic lineages on nanostructures modified with multilayers. Discussion: Hence, the presented system offers great potential to guide stem cell differentiation on surfaces of implants and tissue engineering scaffolds. Objectives: The Gibbs-Donnan theory describes the equilibrium of ionic solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane, when only one solution contains charged macromolecules that cannot pass the membrane. The problem was originally formulated for simple solutions, such as dissociated NaCl, which allowed to calculate the ratio between ions concentrations at the sides of the membrane (Gibbs-Donnan factor). Solutions like plasma and interstitial fluid, and dialysate, contain however ions with different valence, and proteins in each compartment have a different concentration (and therefore charge); the classic theory needs an extension to describe these real-world scenarios. In this study we propose a new method to calculate Gibbs-Donnan factors for such more complex cases. Methods: From electroneutrality considerations and the definition of Nernst potential it is possible to derive a new expression of Gibbs-Donnan factor which depends on the total concentrations of ions of the same valence. This allows, for two solutions A and B, to calculate the concentration of all ions in solution B, given: 1) macromolecule concentrations in A and B, 2) solutes concentrations in A. The transitivity of Donnan factors was proved: for 3 solutions at equilibrium (A, B, C) the factor of A to C is equal to the ratio of the factors from A to B and B to C. Results: As a demonstration, the theory was applied to the calculation of the concentrations in interstitial fluid (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-, HPO42-, SO42-, C3H5O3-) starting from values reported in literature. The calculated interstitial concentrations were close to the reported ones, with a global RMSE equal to 6%. Discussion: The Donnan factors for small ions in biological fluids have relatively small deviation from unity, but their precise value may be of importance for ions whose concentrations are similar at both sides of the membrane, as for example sodium and calcium transport in hemodialyzers and peritoneal dialysis. Objectives: Biobanking of in vitro engineered tissues presents obvious advantages associated with flexible preparation and shipping scheduling. To provide sufficient cryoprotection, alternative research models, freezing approaches and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have to be established in view of complexity and diversity of composite tissues. Here, we evaluated the effects of conventional freezing (CF) and directional freezing (DF) for cryopreservation of cell-seeded electrospun fiber mats. Methods: Fiber mats were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 200:100) using electrospinning. Structure of electrospun mats was characterized using SEM and FTIR, whereas their heat capacity was determined using DSC. The square-shape mats (1x1 cm, UV-sterilized) were seeded with HeLa cells (5x104/scaffold) and cultivated at static conditions. Samples were frozen using 1 K/min to -80 degrees C (CF) or with the directional ice growth at the speed of 30 mu m/sec over a 2.6 mm gradient gap (from -4 to -10 degrees C) i.e. 4 K/min followed by further cooling to -20 degrees C at 1 K/min (translational cryostage) and to -80 degrees C with 1 K/min (LN flow cooling stage). The viability of cells was evaluated 24 h after thawing using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining. Results: PCL-PLA mats exhibited no cytotoxicity on HeLa cells in vitro (viability higher than 90%). Only single cells survived both CF and DF when frozen in culture medium (negative control). In contrast, the majority of cells on fiber mats were alive after freezing under protection of DMSO. Discussion: We showed that although not yet optimized, DF was as effective as CF for cryopreservation of cell-seeded PCL-PLA fiber mats. Preliminary studies on using antifreeze protein Type III (AFPIII) (10 and 100 mu M) as a sole CPA indicates that extracellular protection might not be enough to prevent freezing injury. Our recent work on electroporation of cells within electrospun fiber mats yielded encouraging results and the further initiative will be to deliver AFPs into cells using electroporation to provide DMSO-free cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs. Objectives: Computational tools for accurate evaluation of healthcare products are increasingly being recognized by the European Parliament, US Congress and FDA and represent a highly valuable tool for speeding up and reducing investments associated with the demanding certification process of medical devices. InSilicoTrials Technologies is developing a collaborative, automatized cloud-based platform to assist medical device and pharma companies in performing modelling and simulation activities to accelerate medical innovation while responding to recommendations of European and US parliaments and regulatory bodies. Methods: Simulations provided by scientific partners are integrated within a secured and privacy-preserved environment, ultimately providing the users (companies, research and clinical centers) with in silico solutions for different steps of the R&D process on medical devices and drugs. Simulation results as well as an automatically created simulation report can be formatted in conformity with guidelines provided by EMA and FDA while taking in consideration the new European Medical Device Regulation. Results: Tools currently hosted on the platform are: NuMRIs, an automatic tool to assess magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency safety of medical devices, implemented in collaboration with the US FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health and ANSYS. QT/TdP Risk Screen, an automated tool to assess drug-induced pro-arrhythmic and Torsade de Pointes risk of small molecules, developed in collaboration with Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and Fundacio' Institut Mar d'Investigations Mediques. Discussion: The use of computational technologies to support med registration is limited in scope or absent while the agencies are promoting the use of M&S in R&D and registration. This causes a gap in know-how between reality of the industry and regulatory expectations. InSilicoTrials bridges these gaps and helps industries to conform to regulatory recommendations in a timely and cost-effective manner. Objectives: Dialyzer design enhancing internal filtration may be beneficial to remove middle molecules from the patient's blood for the treatment of renal pathologies. Mathematical models have been proposed to predict the rate of internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions. However, such models generally consist of difficult differential equations, that may not be easily used and implemented in clinical practice. In this work, an analytical model to predict internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions, is presented. Methods: To identify an analytical formula allowing for the prediction of internal filtration, the Poiseuille equation was used to describe axial momentum transport in the blood and dialysate compartment, assuming constant fluid viscosities, whereas radial momentum transport across the membrane was described with the Darcy equation, assuming linear ultrafiltration flux. The model was validated by comparing the pressure profiles in blood and dialysate compartments, and the rate of internal filtration predicted by the model with experimental data reported in literature for in-house Theranova 400 dialyzer. Results: An analytical formula to predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions was obtained. Very good agreement (i.e. percentage error lower than 2%) was found between model predictions and experimental data for blood flow rate increasing from 300 to 400 ml/min, at constant dialyzer flow rate and zero net ultrafiltration flow rate. Good agreement was also found between internal filtration predicted by the analytical model presented in this work, and that predicted by using other one-dimensional mathematical models reported in literature. Discussion: The analytical model presented in this work agrees well with experimental data, and can be used predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions. Objectives: Despite the growing acceptance of LVAD therapy, concerns relating to adverse events have been raised. Fields such as implantation techniques, patient management and patient selection pose opportunities to advance outcomes, however, new and enhanced device technology, such as the ReinVAD LVAD, will have to contribute to improve and grow the therapy. Methods: The ReinVAD GmbH was founded as spin-off company of the Helmholtz-Institute of the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and leads the development project to regulatory approval and clinical application. The core technology is a miniaturized, 3(rd) generation, centrifugal blood pump. It is the result of a multidisciplinary research and development program equipping the system with features that will improve outcome for bridge to transplantation and especially destination therapy patients. Results: Chronic trials typically up to 90 days in a sheep confirm the capabilities of the system with excellent resistance to thrombogenicity since no design related thrombus could be found despite ceased anti-coagulation after 6 weeks. Implemented features are a pump for partial and full support with flow up to 10 l/min, a fully integrated flow sensor, an implantable driveline connector, a highly pressure-sensitive pump characteristic, an automated speed controller and a user-friendly one-piece extracorporeal system. The sensor provides real flow measurements. The driveline connector ensures easy exchange in case of infections and renders the system ready-for-TET. The pump pressure sensitivity, among other effects, leads to increased exercise capacity and arterial pulsation. The controller ensures that the pump always operates at its optimal speed. The one-piece extracorporeal system reduces use errors and improves satisfaction with this component of everyday life. Discussion: The results indicate that the ReinVAD LVAD will be an effective system to enhance long-term circulatory support therapy. Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases shorten life span of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recently pentraxin 3 (PTX) was considered as a biomarker of cardiac function, as well as an inflammatory biomarker. The aim of this study was to investigate if PTX was a useful biomarker to estimate patients' cardiac condition more than as inflammatory biomarker by analysing plasma in PTX, CRP, NT-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP) and troponin T before and after HD. Methods: Twenty patients on chronic HD were studied in a prospective cross-over study with three modes of HD with polysulfone dialyzers: (a) dry-stored (F8HPS, Fresenius) with a low blood level in the venous chamber (DL), (b) dry-stored with a blood level kept high (DH), and (c) a wet-stored dialyzer (Rexeed18L, Asahi Kasei Medical) with high level (WH). PTX, CRP, Pro-BNP and troponin T were assessed before and during 180 min of HD. Results: The mean value of PTX at baseline was correlated to Pro-BNP (rho=0.52, p<0.001) and troponin T (rho=0.363, p= 0.005), but there was no correlation to CRP. The mean value of PTX was significantly increased at 180 min (by 57%) compared to baseline data (p<0.001). The baseline values of PTX correlated with the extent of rise of PTX (rho=0.89, p<0.001), such as a higher baseline was related with more extensive increase. The mean difference value of PTX between baseline to 180 min of HD was correlated to that of Pro-BNP(rho=0.31, p=0.025), while there was no correlation to that of troponin T nor CRP. PTX rose less while on WH than on DL (mean 2.9 +/- 1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.8, p=0.025). There was no difference in PTX at baseline among these three settings. Discussion: These data indicate that PTX is a more evident marker for the influence of the cardiac condition than an inflammatory marker during HD. Dialysis with WH causes least air contamination to the patient what may be a plausible reason for the difference. Objectives: Amniotic membrane (AM) is applied in variety of clinical settings, mainly in wound healing and as a biological dressing. Currently, AM is used in ophthalmology for the treatment of cornea pathologies. In this study, the regenerative potential of human amniotic membrane after cryopreservation was evaluated. Methods: AM was prepared under sterile conditions and frozen without cryoprotectants at -80 degrees C. Native non-cryopreserved AM served as a control. The strategy for AM cryopreservation included one or two freezing and thawing cycles. Cytokine and growth factor profiles as well as morphology and mechanical properties of AM were compared before and after one and two cycles of cryopreservation. Levels of EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and Hyaluronic acid were measured by ELISA. Surface structure of the membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology was evaluated by histological analyses after Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) staining. Additionally, biomechanical characteristics, such as the modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) and the tensile strength, were also investigated. Results: EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and Hyaluronic acid were detected in all studied samples. No significant differences were detected in the levels of those cytokines before and after cryopreservation. SEM analysis showed minor structural alterations of double cryopreserved samples. Analysis of HE stained AM showed minor changes between native and frozen membranes, such as few areas with desquamated epithelium which was caused by repeating freezing and thawing cycles. Mechanical tests did not reveal relevant changes between frozen and non-frozen samples. Discussion: Multiple cryopreservation steps are an essential part of manufacturing of human amniotic membranes to ensure a ready-to-use product availability. This study demonstrated that the cryopreservation does not impair the regenerative potential of AM required to support its therapeutic efficacy. Objectives: Cells are used in bioartificial organs (BAOs) to temporarily replace the complex metabolic functions that neither failing organs, nor their artificial substitutes may provide. This makes cell bioreactors a critical technology for BAOs development. Bioreactors are used for expanding stem (SCs), precursor (PCs), or line cells to clinical mass, for promoting SCs and PCs differentiation to the needed phenotype, and for providing patients with the organ regulatory and synthetic functions needed to foster organ healing or maintain patients state until transplantation (Tx). In some cases, they are also used to regenerate or preserve tissue until Tx. The structural and functional complexity of tissues and organs, the lack of information on their pathophysiology and on disease/damage evolution, the treatment time broadly varying with patients disease and state, all make bioreactor design and operation for BAOs very challenging. Methods: In spite of its complexity, cell bioreactors design for BAOs is generally based on the use of one cell type only (often line cells), scaffolds with suitable immune protective properties, and bioreactor configurations suitable for hosting clinical cell mass and intellectual property protection. Bioreactor performance has been enhanced with actuators to provide cells with mechanical, electrical and/or magnetic cues, often irrespective of tissue or organ specificity. Thus far, this approach has resulted in poor therapeutic success of the proposed BAOs. Results: Cell bioreactor design for BAOs may benefit of the approaches developed over the years to bioreactor design for engineering or regenerating 3D tissue or large solid organs in vitro. Discussion: Prospectively, future approaches to cell bioreactor design for BAOs should be patterned after those typical of tissue engineering and should aim to the optimization of the BAO treatment as a whole. Objectives: To find the most appropriate lock solution for central venous catheters to prevent catheter-related complications. Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched up to August 2018. We included randomized controlled trials comparing different lock solutions for adult dialysis patients (> 18 years old). The trials should report at least one primary or secondary outcome. Network meta-analyses of outcomes were performed using the netmeta 0.9-6 package in R (version 3.5.1). Other analyses were carried out by means of the network and network graphs packages in Stata version 15.0. Results: 50 trials (7142 patients) were included for this study. Compared with heparin 5000U/ml, antibiotic locks (antibiotics with TSC, EDTA, heparin 5000U/ml, low-dose heparin, or urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/ml. No lock solution reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared with heparin 5000 U/ml. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin was ranked as the best lock solution. Considering the toxicity and drug resistance of antibiotics, ethanol could be the alternative antimicrobial lock solution. The overall results were not materially changed in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: In total, according to the two-dimensional graph, antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml) was the highest ranking lock solution, as it reduced the rates of CRBSI and the risk of bleeding significantly. Ethanol was the promising alternative antimicrobial lock solution of antibiotics to combine with anticoagulant agents. TSC alone did not prevent CRBSI, but it is safe. Objectives: The Fontan procedure is the current standard and the best palliative treatment for most patients with a functional univentricular heart. During the Fontan procedure the caval veins are anastomosed to the pulmonary arteries. The resulting total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) allows for the support of an acceptable level of pulmonary circulation. At the same time there is the high risk of cardiovascular system failure due to the increased load on a single ventricle. In order to increase patient survival and quality of life, the different TCPC connections aimed at improving blood hemodynamic seems to be a logical treatment option. Methods: A CFD study was carried out for four types of TCPC (TCPC-1, TCPC-2, TCPC-3, TCPC-4) to determine the optimal connection from the point of view of hydraulic and power losses with and without the rotary blood pump (RBP) connected. The distribution of scalar shear stresses (SSS) in the volume was calculated, allowing for evaluation of the effect of the RBP on the blood at the operating point of 2.2 l/min and 11 mmHg of head pressure. Results: The results showed that the TCPC-3 connection has the optimal geometry, as there is a decrease in hydraulic losses corresponding to 5 mmHg, with power losses of 0.055 W. Hydraulic losses and power losses for other types of TCPC are equal to 6 mmHg and 0.07 W for TCPC-2, 9 mmHg and 0.08 W for TCPC-4, 10 mmHg and 0.09 W for TCPC-1 respectively. The geometry optimization of the TCPC connection can significantly reduce the system losses, but only the integration of the RBP prevents these losses even for non-optimal TCPC. Discussion: Although the use of a pump has significantly reduced losses, the presence of increased SSS can have a negative effect on blood. The obtained values of SSS will allow in the future the estimation of the degree of blood damage and, as a consequence, hemolysis level. Objectives: The complex tree-like architecture of the lungs that ends with tiny alveolar sacs is difficult to mimic in-vitro. The delicate and ultra-thin alveolar barrier with its air-liquid interface is constantly exposed to the rhythmic respiratory movements. We report here about two organs-on-chip models that uniquely reproduce this environment and in which patients 'cells are cultured. A first model recapitulates an array of alveoli with in-vivo dimensions using a biological stretchable membrane. The second model mimics a functional lung capillary network. Methods: The key part of the lung alveolar model is a biological membrane made of collagen and elastin (CE) that is pipetted on a gold mesh, whose pores correspond to the alveolar size (about 200um). Once the dried CE-membrane is rehydrated, primary human cells (alveolar epithelial and endothelial) can be cultured on both sides. The second model is based on the self-assembly of endothelial cells and pericytes that are confined in fibrin gel in microengineered compartments. Results: A functional alveolar barrier made of primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung endothelial cells is reported. The CE-membrane, on which the cells are cultured, is thin (a few micrometers), porous (enables the culture of cells at the air-liquid interface during several days), and stretchable. The reported lung microvasculature made of self-assembled endothelial cells and pericytes is perfusable, vasoactive (contracts in presence of phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor) and is permeable. Discussion: These advanced in-vitro models enable mimicking the lung parenchymal environment in an unprecedented way. As a result, the cultured tissues made of primary human lung cells are able to maintain organ-specific functions, such as air-blood barrier tightness and microvascular perfusability and contractility. Organs-on-chip solutions, such as those presented here, may open new possibilities for specific tissue engineering applications. Objectives: Development of simple and effective technologies for cell storage at positive temperatures facilitates to extend their use and ensures safe transport between research and clinical centers. The aim is to study the viability and metabolic activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) encapsulated in alginate microspheres (AMS) during storage at positive temperatures. Methods: The experiments were performed on human dermal MSCs derived from adult donors after their informed consent. MSCs in suspension and in AMS were stored in sealed cryovials at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C. Cell viability and metabolic activity were evaluated by MTT- and AlamarBlue-tests and the ability to adhere to the culture plastic. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed with fluorescent dye JC-1. Differentiation potential was evaluated after cells induction to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Results: Encapsulation in AMS supported viability and metabolic activity of MSCs during storage in culture medium at ambient temperature at list for 3 days. Storage of MSCs under hypothermic conditions (4 degrees C) using special media contributed to a longer sustainability of cell viability. During storage alginate encapsulated cells retained the ability to multilineage differentiation, but had lower metabolic activity and mitochondrial membrane potential than cells in monolayer. On release from alginate microspheres, the cells were shown to attach, reverse metabolic activity and proliferate in a similar manner to that seen before encapsulation. Discussion: Encapsulation in alginate microspheres may be considered as a cheap and robust alternative to cryopreservation for the shirt-term storage and transport of cells for clinical and research projects. Objectives: In case of organ failure, several options can theoretically be considered, thanks to the progresses in medicine, materials science and biotechnology: i) transplant the same organ from a donor, ii) replace the functions of the failing organ by an artificial one, iii) repair its structure thanks to cell therapy or iv) engineer a new one in vitro before its implantation. Methods: As far as abdominal organs (kidney, liver, pancreas), the history of organ replacement follows different ways that will be considered. In addition to medical and scientific hurdles, economical or ethical issues can drive the choices for the \"best\" solution for the patient. Results: The case of pancreas is very specific since its transplantation is not the first option chosen to treat the failing organs, whereas it represents the gold standard for the liver and the kidney. In the case of liver, we still have to face the lack of purely artificial organ to treat acute liver failure or even chronic disease. Discussion: This is due to the complexity of the organs and the variety of its functions, some of them remaining relatively unknown. In this case, the option of engineering new liver in vitro combining hepatic cells of different phenotypes with an adequate matrix allowing high blood perfusion appears as the most promising option. Several approaches have been proposed, starting from the \"basic\" use of a semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane to host the cells to the bioprinting of the whole organ. We will discuss here the pros and cons of these different strategies. SensorStim Neurotechnology GmbH is a start-up of the TU Berlin. The business area is medical engineering based on neurostimulation and eHealth for rehabilitation and homecare. Our vision is to help people with limited mobility due to paralysis, spasticity or pain and to mobilize them with technical assistance. Our novel medical device enables the use of noninvasive neurostimulation for rehabilitation and therapy of people with disabilities after damage to the central nervous system - brain, spinal cord, pyramidal tract. It is mobile, easy to use and it can be used in water, too. Our device consists of a neurostimulator combined with body sensors and can be operated via a smart App. Furthermore, it can be used for clinical and home care. After a successful market entry, we further want to support walking, cycling and aqua gymnastics with electrical stimulation. We started in 2018 and are currently funded by grants of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) and private equity and development cooperations. By the end of 2019, we plan to achieve CE marking for our first product and ISO 13485 certification for our quality management system. Objectives: Intraventricular flow patterns during mechanical circulatory support (MCS) cannot be accessed by clinical imaging; therefore, either computational or in-vitro models are used. However, the complex anatomy of the heart cannot be replicated and simulations inherently rely on assumptions and simplifications. In an isolated porcine heart setup the feasibility of flow measurements by Echocardiographic Particle Image Velocimetry (E-PIV) was evaluated. Methods: Similar to cardiac transplantation, porcine hearts (n=8, animal weight: 80-106 kg) were excised and connected to the isolated heart setup. After resuscitation using blood as perfusate, a rotary blood pump was implanted, microbubbles were injected via the left atrium at different support situations and echocardiographic 3-chamber-view B-mode images were recorded with the highest possible frame rate of up to 141 Hz (Philips iE33, X5-1 xMatrix probe). By iterative PIV algorithms using correlation domain averaging and beam sweep correction, flow fields were evaluated for the different hemodynamic situations. Results: All hearts were successfully resuscitated in the isolated heart setup and different hemodynamic situations were adjusted. In the unsupported heart physiologic flow patterns with a large clockwise vortex structure that warrants washout of the whole cardiac chamber were found. With increasing MCS (2200-2700 rpm) the formation of this flow feature is diminished caused by the additional flow sink at the apex. In full support, without aortic valve opening in the left ventricular outflow tract, a stagnant structure was identified, that might be connected to thromboembolic events. Discussion: For the first time, the contribution of the mitral valve apparatus to blood flow patterns especially in the LVOT, which may be linked to energy loss, thrombus formation and valve deterioration during MCS was investigated under realistic conditions. Objectives: In order to determine the most effective ratio of liver cells (LC) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MSC BM) into implantable cell-engineering constructs (CECs) used for a correcting of chronic liver failure (CLF). Methods: In order to create liver CECs we employed a biopolymer implant - a composition of a heterogeneous collagen-containing gel, which concluded viable LC and MSC BM in ratios:1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 respectively. CECs with different ratios of LC and MSC BM were implanted into the livers of rats (n=40) in which CLF was modeled by using CCl4. The efficiency of the regulatory effects of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric methods at different periods after their implantation. Results: During studying of the liver CECs with various ratios of LC and MSC BM (1:1, 5:1, 10:1), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the CECs was 5:1, because at such ratio of cells the most distinct normalization of morphological and functional liver parameters as well as maintenance of the structural homeostasis within the CECs took place within 365 days after modeling CLF. Discussion: The effective correction of CLF can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which donor liver cells and MSC BM are presented in ratios - 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and functional parameters at CECs using allows to recommend the preference using of CECs using with ratio 5:1, because prolonged preservation of structural homeostasis into themselves CECs makes possible to prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver transplantation. Conventional hemolysis researches were performed under mainly constant shear stress, however, real flow in vivo would be under fluctuating shear stress. In addition, several conventional numerical simulations predicted abrupt shear stress fluctuation in the blood pumps in short time period. Furthermore, it was also reported that erythrocyte showed its unique viscoelastic shape change response to sinusoidal changing shear stress. Based on such information, we hypothesized that abrupt shear change would be additional hemolysis factor in addition to conventional shear stress and its exposure time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of such our hypothesis. We developed special cylindrical shear chamber which can generate varying shear stress by controlling the rotational speed. This study used the shear device to generate several trapezoidal waveforms of shear stresses. In such shear fluctuation, the maximal shear stress of approximate 22.5 Pa were loaded to porcine whole blood for 5.0 seconds. And the time series integrated shear stress was set to equal between abrupt and slow shear change conditions. Then, generated hemolysis levels were compared between them. Each comparative studies were performed for twelve times. Furthermore, such studies were repeated under several different shear change speeds. The result of our all comparison showed greater hemolysis amount at abruptly fluctuating shear condition. Such results successfully validated our hypothesis. Objectives: Ex vivo platelet production in microfluidic bioreactors is a promising alternative to platelet donation for transfusion therapy. Platelets are formed by fragmentation of large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes (MK). Hydrodynamic forces play a major role in the formation of platelets. In this work, we design microfluidic chips where isolated MK are exposed to hydrodynamic forces and we characterize their elongation and fragmentation. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane chips are fabricated using standard soft lithography protocols and sealed to a glass slide. The 50 mu m deep rectangular chambers contain rows of 30 mu m-wide adhesive pillars. Human CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord blood are differentiated in vitro for 12 days to yield mature MK and infused with a concentration of 2x10(5) /mL into the chips at a wall shear rate of 1800s(-1). Their elongation and fragmentation is monitored by videomicroscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ. Results: We perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MK elongation and show that platelet release is always preceded by a remodeling of the cell that spans over about 20 minutes, followed by a local, sudden increase in elongation velocity (5-fold increase in the 10 seconds prior to fragmentation). The amplitude of these variations is much larger than the spatial and temporal variations in the surrounding flow field. Discussion: Earlier studies have shown that dynamic conditions for in vitro platelet production not only accelerates the process but also enhances the quality of released platelets. Here, we show that MK elongation and fragmentation, though accelerated by the flow, are not solely governed by fluid-structure interactions. It seems that other mechanisms are involved in the regulation of platelet release, preventing it to occur before the platelet is fully functional. Objectives: The Eulerian version of the strain-based hemolysis model has already shown to predict different critical regions in blood pumps compared to the commonly used stress-based models. Where the stress-based model assumes an instantaneous deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) due to the action of fluid forces, the strain-based model is able to estimate the viscoelastic deformation of RBCs. Thus, the effect of exposure time is considered in a natural way. However, both models are based on the empirical power law assumption for hemoglobin transport and turned out to overpredict hemolysis compared to experimental data. In order to improve the prediction of free-plasma hemoglobin, the strain-based model is combined with a multiscale model for hemoglobin transport. The model is able to account for pore formation in the RBC membrane and the resulting hemoglobin mass transfer into the blood plasma. Thus, the model does not rely on the power law assumption. Methods: The formation of pores is computed based on an energy balance of the stretched RBC membrane, where an area strain can be computed by the tensor equation of the strain-based model. The hemoglobin release is modeled by a transport equation with a mass transfer coefficient as a function of shear, which can be fitted to the data of blood shearing experiments. As an application, the model is used for a benchmark blood pump provided by the FDA. Results: The estimated total hemolytic performance for the benchmark blood pump is significantly reduced compared to the power law version of the strain-based model. The new results are in good agreement with the measured data by the FDA. Discussion: The multiscale model for hemoglobin transport turns out to be a useful extension of the strain-based hemolysis model, allowing for an overall more physical model description of the hemolysis process. Application to different devices and blood shearing experiments should be investigated in the future, in order to study the parameter sensitivity. Objectives: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed structures, which are released from all types of cells upon activation. Two examples for the role of EVs in extracorporeal therapies will be discussed in detail, (i) EVs as markers for cellular activation and (ii) EVs as platform for the binding of plasma proteins. We assessed the impact of regional citrate anticoagulation (2.8 vs. 5.6 mM) on the cellular activation in lipoprotein apheresis, using EVs as marker for cellular activation upon blood-adsorbent interaction. Moreover, we studied the ability of a commercial adsorbent (PentraSorb) for C-reactive protein (CRP) to remove both, soluble and EV-associated CRP from septic plasma. Methods: EVs were characterized in human blood or plasma via flow cytometry after calibration with fluorescent silica beads (1 mu m, 0.5 mu m, 0.3 mu m; Kisker Biotech). Phosphatidylserine-exposing EVs were identified as lactadherin-positive events in the EV gate. Antibodies against cell specific surface markers (CD41 for platelets, CD235a for red blood cells) were used to identify the cellular origin of EVs. An anti-CRP antibody was used to identify CRP carrying EVs. Results: During lipoprotein apheresis, platelet adhesion to the adsorbent polymer and EV release were associated with elevated markers for platelet activation and EV release was dependent on the citrate concentration in the extracorporeal circuit. Septic plasma contained significantly elevated levels of EVs, CRP+ EVs, as well as soluble CRP as compared to healthy donors. Incubation of plasma with the CRP adsorbent resulted in almost complete depletion of soluble CRP, and remaining EVs did not show any association with CRP, indicating detachment of CRP from the EVs. Discussion: In the context of apheresis, EVs can be considered as markers for cellular activation. Moreover, our data show that EVs can serve as a platform for the binding of CRP, which has been suggested to induce conformational changes of CRP and a shift towards pro-inflammatory characteristics. Objectives: In developing endovascular treatment devices, understanding their physical properties is one of the most important points. We have been developed film-type sensor for force measurement, applied to the field of biomechanics. In this study, the blood vessel model embedded pressure film sensor was fabricated and the contact pressure distribution in the circumferential direction was measured at balloon dilatation. Methods: The film sensor was constructed by a couple of patterned electrodes and pressure-sensitive layer. The film sensor was rolled and embedded to straight-shape silicone vessel model. The balloon catheter was expanded in a mock vessel. Results: The measured pressure at the mock vessel increased according to balloon dilatation pressure. At expanding of general balloon, the measured pressure at each point was almost the same. When expanding a scoring balloon, a balloon with wedge elements, the measured pressure at wedge contact points was higher than that of the other parts. Discussion: It is considerable that stress concentration state changes depending on the wedge shape and/or stiffness. The mock vessel is useful to understand dilatation property of scoring balloon. Objectives: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat acute respiratory and circulatory failure. Recent advancements have led to impressive improvements in treatment results. Now clinicians urge for an ever-earlier ECMO application and a broadening of the indications: Mobility demand -> Every ECMO patient needs to be transported under severely restricted space conditions. Cost demand -> With rising ECMO numbers the cost ratio plays an increasing role for healthcare economics. Methods: A novel system uses a recombination of existing technologies to create a straightforward solution with a size and complexity reduction. The key principle is the sourcing of pump energy from the oxygen pressure, which is required to ventilate the oxygenator anyway. This modification allows a purely pneumatic operation and the usage of pulsatile pumps. Results: A pneumatically powered dual chamber pulsatile pump has been developed which avoids suction and high shear rates with improved wash out behaviour for the entire ECC system. The innovative pump is driven completely pneumatically without a complex and expensive driving console. Furthermore, a novel oxygenator has been developed. Initial prototypes of pumps and oxygenators have been optimized during multiple design iterations and tested in terms hydraulic characteristics and gas exchange properties on the bench using water glycerol and porcine blood. The entire system has a reduced surface area and priming volume and shows low internal pressure loss, excellent wash out and gas exchange parameters. The bench test results have been confirmed within a chronic GLP in vivo study in large animals. The new device's size and complexity have been significantly reduced compared to the state of the art systems. Discussion: The novel approach brings many advantages for the next generation ECMO/ECLS systems particularly in terms of function, mobility and cost-effectiveness. Objectives: The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards recommend bovine blood for in vitro testing of medical devices. Haemodilution is used to standardise haematocrit (HCT) to 30 +/- 2% with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Research has shown that PBS increases red blood cell mechanical fragility and significantly increases haemolysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of diluent and dilution for in vitro testing, which may result in future considerations for ASTM standards. Methods: Bovine blood was diluted with either PBS or PBS+4g% BSA (bovine serum albumin) to a HCT of 30 +/- 2%. The blood was either pumped with the CentriMag (R) (Thoratec,USA) device under haemodynamic conditions or exposed to VAD-like shear for 6 hours. Blood was diluted to a range of 70-94% (n=40). Plasma free haemoglobin levels were measured to calculate the normalised index of haemolysis (NIH). Protein concentrations were measured. Results: Haemodilution altered mechanical fragility depending on diluent and concentration. At a 70% blood dilution, PBS alone caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS+4g% BSA. However, at a 90% blood dilution, PBS+4g% BSA caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS alone. As such, a positive correlation was observed between dilution with PBS alone and NIH, whereas a negative correlation was observed between dilution with PBS+4g% BSA and NIH. Total protein concentration was significantly reduced at a 70% blood dilution with PBS alone but not at 90%. Discussion: To reach a HCT of 30%+/- 2%, this study recommends that bovine blood with a HCT of > 37% should be diluted with PBS + 4g% BSA (>80% blood dilution), whereas blood with a HCT of <37% should be diluted with PBS alone (<80% blood dilution). Haemodilution with BSA maintains physiological protein concentrations and may reduce bias during haemolysis testing with high dilutions. Thus, ASTM standards could consider including BSA as a diluent, when needed. Objectives: Obtaining normal serum potassium level is an important goal in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemia is known to be associated with mortality. In this study we aimed to access the relationship between pre-dialysis potassium level, nutritional status and survival in dialysis patients. Methods: This study used annual cohort of hemodialysis patients with 36 months of follow up. To determine the impact of potassium level on mortality, patients were followed from first potassium measurement until death or a censoring event; hypokalemia was defined by potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/l and albumin levels below 35g/l was considered an index for undernourished. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the association between potassium level and mortality. Results: 199 patients were included in the study. Mean age was approximately 56 years, about 59% were men and 23% had end-stage renal disease caused by diabetes. Albumin below 35g/l was observed in 26 (13%) of the patients. In the follow up period 40 (20%) patients died, comprising 24 (32%) of the 74 hypokalemic and 16 (19%) of 82 hyperkalemic patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was significantly longer in the hyperkalemic population (34.30 +/- 0.71 vs 31.06 +/- 1.16, p=0.055). Hypokalemia, when defined as serum potassium 5.5 pound mmol/l, was associated with all-cause mortality (hazards ratio (HR) 1.857, 95% CI 0.986-3.496, p = 0.051). The significance was lost in the model after adjustment for albumin level. Only albumin level determined mortality (p=0.03). Discussion: Lower potassium level was associated with all-cause mortality, but only as a confounding effect of malnutrition in dialysis patients Objectives: A new method to adhere biological tissue to another or to metal such as stainless steel using integrated low-level energy sources, heat, pressure, and vibration is proposed. Methods: Heat, pressure, and vibration are simultaneously delivered by pressing the porcine aorta tissues on the vibration plate with the heated tip. Tensile tests on adhered specimens were performed to determine adhesion characteristics to adhesion temperature, time, pressure, and vibration. The effect of metal surface coating, fluorine-doped DLC coating, on the adhesion strength was examined. In one application, the inlet port of a ventricular assist device adhered to a porcine ventricle muscle by applying the novel method with a temperature of 80 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Sufficient adhesion was observed without additional vibration. In a second application, the vessel adhesion apparatus was developed to connect a bypass graft to a coronary artery. The device has both a heating and pressurizing part on the tip, which was used to attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery by applying heat with a temperature of 120 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Results and Discussion: The maximal shear tensile strength using the proposed novel adhesion method was 200 kPa, which is half the strength of the porcine aorta. Adhesion strength increased in proportion to temperature, time, and pressure. The adhesion strength can be controlled by surface treatment of metals. In the first application, the inlet port adhered to the ventricle muscle with a shear tensile strength of 91 kPa, which is enough to keep the pump attached to the ventricle. In the second application, the bypass graft adhered to the coronary artery with a shear tensile strength of 50 kPa, which is sufficient to maintain attachment when exposed to normal blood pressure. The proposed adhesion method indicates satisfactory performance. Objectives: The requirements for safety and efficacy of medical devices are constantly increasing leading to higher costs and time to market. Simulations are proving to be particularly promising in accelerating the approval process and at the same time further increasing patient safety. The FDA related Medical Device Innovation Consortium predicts that in some years about 40% of the evidences for regulatory approval are coming from virtual patients and simulations. What is the status today and how do we get there? Methods: Simulations can improve the regulatory assessment in various phases of the product life cycle, e.g. to justify design adjustments, worst-case estimates of sizes and variants, definition of test loads for experiments, to perform virtual tests on a large number of patients/conditions or to identify the root cause of failure. This may especially be important in consideration of the future requirements of the MDR for patient-specific implants. Results: So far, the use of simulations was hindered by a lack of guidance and expectations within the medical device community. However, today the FDA and ASME are strongly supporting the use of this approach with new guidelines (guidance 1807) and a V&V standard (V&V40). \"FDA's Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories has committed significant resources for transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool because of its potential for significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use or that could more effectively be evaluated with simulation.\" Discussion: Computer-aided simulations have the potential to revolutionize the field of regulatory approval. However, it is crucial that the simulations are performed with care and its limitations are understood. To foster confidence and wider acceptance of in silico methods, a proper methodology is needed to ensure appropriate credibility. Objectives: TAVI is the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients or in patients with too high risk for conventional surgery. CT-scan is mandatory for valve sizing. It requires injection of contrast medium that may cause or increase kidney failure. The study aim was to establish the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a no contrast medium technique, for measurements of native aortic valve in patients undergoing TAVI. Values by IVUS were compared to CT-scan ones in the same patients. Methods: From June 2014 to January 2019 137 consecutive patients (74 M, mean age 82.7 +/- 5.6 years) (Logistic EuroSCORE 22.7 +/- 14.9%; STS score mortality 21.3 +/- 13.7%) undergoing TAVI through femoral access were enrolled. Each patient had high resolution angio-CT for these measurements: diameter, perimeter, and area of the aortic annulus. In all patients, during procedure and before prosthetic valve implantation, a manual IVUS pullback, from left ventricular outflow tract to ascending aorta, was performed by 7F IVUS probe. On the recorded IVUS pullback, a second operator blind to CT measures sized minimum and maximum diameter, perimeter and area of the aortic annulus. In order to assess inter-rater concordance and agreement between CT and IVUS data, Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's correlation were applied. A p value Results: A very strong correlation was found between the measures. Maximum diameter: CT 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs IVUS 2.6 +/- 0.3 cm; r=+0.985; pDiscussion: These results prove the accuracy and reliability of aortic annulus measurements by IVUS compared to those by CT-scan. Sizing of the aortic annulus by IVUS only may be considered in patients likely to develop kidney failure due to contrast medium injection. Objectives: The long-term usage of rotary blood pumps is limited by the high amount of blood damage, which leads to a high number of adverse events. Most of the blood damage is generated in the gap between the rotor blades and the housing wall, the area with the highest stress load and very short exposure times. The damage is caused by both shear and normal forces on the blood components. The objective is to investigate the blood damage in this region by examining different gap geometries. The focus is the damage caused by high dynamic normal stresses and the comparison with the blood damage models. Methods: A section of the blade gap of an axial rotary blood pump was reconstructed on a microchannel chip, which is sealed with siliconized cover glasses. In additional channels the inlet and outlet rounding are varied between 0.05 and 0.6 mm. The gap length and width are kept the same for all channels. A channel without a blade gap is integrated to determine the damage caused by the test stand. Flow simulations are carried out to determine the occurring stresses. The test stand consists of a syringe pump that transports 20 mL of human blood back and forth through the microchannels for up to 6 hours. Hemolysis is measured every half hour. Results: With the test stand it is possible to investigate the influence of different gap geometries on the blood damage under controlled conditions. The experiments demonstrated the influence of different inlet and outlet geometries on the hemolysis. The measured hemolysis was compared with the damage models. Discussion: With the test stand it is possible to simulate the stress loads in blade gaps on human blood. The influence of the high dynamic normal stresses on hemolysis can also be determined through variations of the inlet and outlet. It is therefore a well-suited tool for improving the corresponding damage models in the area of high dynamic stress loads. The findings allow the optimization of the region to further reduce blood damage caused by rotary blood pumps. Objectives: Cardiac grafts produced by combining human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derivatives and tissue engineering are a promising therapeutic option for the replacement of cardiomyocytes (CM) lost due to myocardial infarction. Currently, the vascularization and maturation of such grafts are the most critical aspects. In addition to endothelial cells (EC), pericytes (PC) are known to play a crucial role in vessel development and stabilization. Methods: Here, an hPSC-derived PC differentiation protocol is shown as well as an in vitro model for the investigation of the role of PCs in hPSC-derived bioartificial cardiac tissues (BCT). Results: In the established differentiation protocol, the population giving rise to PCs (CD31-/PDGFR beta+) represented up to 94% of all cells and could be further purified via cell sorting. The obtained hPSC-PCs exhibited functional characteristics of PCs in co-culture assays, and showed similar gene expression profile to primary PCs. Differentiated hPSC-PCs were used w/ or w/o purified hPSC-ECs to generate BCTs and to address their effect on tissue morphology, metabolism, and electrophysiological parameters compared to control tissues containing primary fibroblasts (Fb). Interestingly, tissues with hPSC-PCs exhibited equivalent contraction forces compared to controls, but more organized sarcomere structures as well as improved longitudinal cell- and extracellular matrix orientation. Furthermore, the beating frequency and passive forces showed native-like values. Addition of hPSC-ECs resulted in spontaneously formed and maintained endothelial network structures, which were distributed throughout the BCTs and the involvement of PCs in such structures was demonstrated. Discussion: The characterized and functional hPSC-PCs together with hPSC-derived CMs and ECs represent a promising cell source for myocardial tissue replacement therapy. Their dual ability in supporting EC function and matrix remodeling during tissue maturation makes them a favorable candidate to replace primary Fbs. Objectives: High prevalence of thrombi around the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) cannula has been proven by pathological studies. Thrombogenic potential (TP) inside of the left ventricle (LV) is evaluated based on shear stress history (SSH) and residence time (RT) of particles; however, the effect of the atrial inflow - including rotation and uneven flow distribution of the pulmonary veins - is ignored. In this study, the influence of the atrial inflow on the TP was investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Methods: In a patient-specific left ventricle (LV) model under full LVAD support, the flow fields were simulated with three different inflow conditions: with perpendicular velocity to the inflow (LAper, flow rate: 3.5l/min), with an additional rotational component at the inflow (LArot: 35rpm) and with asymmetric inflow conditions (LAasym: 60%/40% left/right). Platelet motion was simulated with a combination of laminar and the Lagrangian methods for 7s. The TP value was calculated based on the RT and SSH of particles (0<TP<1, with higher values corresponding to higher risk). Results: The ventricular flow patterns were comparable for perpendicular and rotational inflows and different for asymmetric conditions. TP values were different for each of the atrial inflow conditions (LAasym: 0.37, LArot: 0.35, LAper: 0.4). The number of the particles with a SSH value more than 0.6 Pa center dot s (non-outlier range) increased for LAasym simulation (LAasym: 11%, LArot: 5%, LAper: 3%;p<0.05); however the particles that remain for more than 7s inside the LV were higher for LAper simulation (LAasym: 13%, LArot: 18%, LAper: 19%;p<0.05). Discussion: CFD is an advanced tool for the evaluation of ventricular flow during LVAD support; however, neglecting the atrial inflow conditions could lead to an inaccurate prediction of flow parameters linked to ventricular and pump thrombosis. Reliable evaluation of ventricular blood flow, therefore, requires the consideration of realistic atrial inflow conditions. Objectives: Thrombus formation is a major risk of implants with artificial materials in blood contact. This adhesion of blood platelets plays an important role in thrombus formation and is influenced by the electrochemical conditions of the surface. The objective of this research is to change the electrochemical conditions by applying a low voltage, high frequency alternating electrical current to the surface, in order to avoid the adhesion of the platelets involved in thrombus formation. Methods: Thin sheet samples with a thickness of 0.5 mm from different materials (titanium, stainless steel and copper) are attached to a high frequency generator and exposed to human whole blood under controlled flow conditions in an in vitro setting. An electrical current ranging from 50 mu A until 400 mu A in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 100 kHz was applied. The deposition of the blood platelets on the surface is identified and quantified by using fluorescent microscopy and digital image processing. The thrombus formation and therefore the anti-thrombogenic effect of the method is investigated in respect to different generator settings for each material. Results: The characterization of all materials revealed changes of the surfaces in comparison to the zero samples. A differently pronounced reduction of thrombus formation with the proposed anti-thrombogenic method could be demonstrated on all three materials. Discussion: Though the method could improve the anti-thrombogenicity under certain conditions, the mechanism is not fully understood yet and the parameters are not optimized. Further investigations will also focus on possible side effects caused by potential structural changes of blood proteins. Objectives: Cationic liposomes OO4 (N-{6-amino-1-[N-(9Z) -octadec9-enylamino] -1-oxohexan-(2S) -2-yl} -N0- {2- [N, N-bis(2-aminoethyl) amino] ethyl} -2-hexadecylpropandiamide) and DOPE contain a higher amount of amino groups than classical lipids. A polyelectrolyte multilayer system (PEM) made of chondroitin sulphate (CS) and collagen type I (COL I) was prepared by Layer-by-Layer technique with liposomes embedded in the terminal layers for the controlled release of components to promote osteogenic differentiation for bone regeneration. Methods: Characterization of the PEM was performed using ellipsometry. This technique was used to investigate the thickness on substrate coated with PEM of CS, liposomes, COL I as terminal layer. The layer growth behavior of PEM was studied using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The cell adhesion of C2C12 cells and the cellular uptake efficiency of the liposomes embedded onto PEM was evaluated using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Results: The SPR results showed a linear growth with an increase in the angle shift corresponding to the adsorbed mass of PEM. The increase in thickness after liposome adsorption was significant. The cell studies indicated that cells seeded on terminal liposome layer showed a higher amount of cells on the surface. The population of cells that took up liposomes are higher in the absence of serum than in medium with FBS. Discussion: The quantification of liposome uptake indicated that the population of cells that took up liposomes were higher in the absence of serum. The results showed the uptake efficiency of cationic liposomes embedded onto a PEM system for controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic models compounds into the cells. Objectives: Many different tissue sealants are available on the market. BioGlue tissue sealants are produced by a bovine serum albumin treated intra-operatively with glutaraldehyde. Here we report a sterile peri-graft abscess formation, possibly caused as a reaction to the liberal use of BioGlue. Methods: A-54 years-old male patient underwent ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Exceptionally, the anastomotic suture line was reinforced by application of BioGlue tissue sealant. The initial post-operative course was uneventful. After transfer to the general ward on day four the patient developed fever and an inflammatory syndrome. A broad spectrum antibiotherapy was started for a suspicion of pneumonia. In the following chest CT scan a suspicious peri-graft fluid collection was present. The patient underwent a surgical revision for acute mediastinitis rule out. During the procedure a whitish-milky liquid was found that differed macroscopically from a classical abscess. The chest was left open with a negative-pressure wound dressing. The patient became apyretic and the inflammatory markers normalized. After a one week follow-up with negative cultures and 3 consecutive dressing changes, the chest was closed and recovery uneventful. The patient was discharged to an outside hospital at six post-operative days. Results: All the samples which were analysed histologically and for different pathologic stains as well as and by broad spectrum culture analysis, remained negative throughout. At one month follow-up the patient remained well and without fever or inflammatory response. Discussion: Although several published case reports about tissue necrosis and anastomotic rupture following BioGlue use, the formation of a sterile abscess is a rare complication. In this patient, the peri-graft effusion might have been an allergy like inflammatory response to the bovine albumin within BioGlue. A prolonged postoperative mediastinal drainage when using BioGlue might prevent this rare complication. Objectives: The use of loop diuretics like furosemide is discussed in intensive care medicine regarding their clinical efficacy and safety. The hypothesis arose whether both parameters depend on the capability of serum albumin to transfer the drug to the kidneys. Methods: Serial blood & urine samples were taken from intensive care patients receiving furosemide infusions for volume overload. Free furosemide serum fractions & urine concentrations were determined by HPLC/LCMS. Albumin binding capacity (ABiC) was quantified by adding a binding site II (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine, DS). The amount of unbound DS was detected by fluorescence analysis after ultrafiltration, corresponding with ABiC. Results: 62 patients were assessed. 50 patients (30male, 67,5 +/- 10,3 years) were included into statistical analysis. Main reasons for intensive care admission were sepsis (n=18) and perioperative care. Indications for furosemide were volume overload in acute or acute on chronic kidney injury (n=42), volume management in sepsis, ARDS or lung edema (n=8). ABiC was reduced to 65,2+/-12,2%, The free furosemide fraction (normal <5%) correlated negatively with ABiC (r -0,638, p<0,001) with 15,76+/-11,52% in those with ABIC<60% and 5,36+/-5,29% in ABiC 60% (p<0,001). The urinary fraction of furosemide (normal >65%) was significantly lower in those with ABiC <60% as compared to 60% (7,47+/-5,83% vs. 23,98+/-17,91, p<0,01). Furosemide induced increase in urine output was strongly correlated with ABiC (r=0,908, p<0,017). Discussion: Our results indicate a role of ABiC in the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, impacting its free serum fraction and urinary fraction. Data are suggestive for a link between status of the albumin-dependend drug carrier mechanism and the safety and efficacy of the drug. Clinicians will profit from our results regarding safe use of loop diuretics & furosemide responsiveness in patients with volume overload and kidney injury. Objectives: Albumin is a blood protein with various physiological functions as there are: maintenance of osmotic pressure, antioxidant and transport function for endogenous and exogenous ligands. Binding of these ligands can affect conformational changes of human serum albumin. Methods: The \"Albumin-functionality-test\" is based on EPR spectroscopy and detects modified binding and functional characteristics. The used radical supporting spin probe binds analogous ligands variably strong at different albumin binding sites and thus, serves as an indirect marker for serum albumin functionality with regard to its ability for binding, transport and detoxification. A comparison of three different mixtures of albumin and a spin-labeled fatty acid allows for the in vitro simulation of binding-, transport- and release-conditions by the Albumin-functionality-test. Thus, an \"effective\" albumin concentration could be determined. It quantifies the amount of functional albumin in the patient in comparison to healthy controls. Results: We applied Albumin-functionality-test to albumin preparations differing in redox state of cysteine-34, namely human mercaptalbumin (HMA), human non-mercaptalbumin1 (HNA1) and human non-mercaptalbumin2 (HNA2) and found differences in their functionality. The analysis of samples from patients with different states of liver failure showed a strong correlation of binding efficiency and detoxification efficiency, depending on the severity of the disease. Discussion: Due to the increasing numbers of studies using commercial albumin preparations for the treatment of patients with liver disease, we investigated different available albumin samples regarding their albumin functionality. We found dramatically reduced binding and detoxification efficiencies. Our findings might be used for patient selection and prognoses for personalized therapies. Taken together, these results might affect the importance of albumin from the patient view and refer to its stability as a drug. Objectives: The analysis of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) power is a commonly used method to identify complications such as pump thrombosis. However, the LVAD power is also affected by different influences like the circadian rhythm. To optimize our thrombosis detection algorithm, we analyzed LVAD log files. Methods: For the investigation of power behavior in LVAD log files, we retrospectively analyzed 840 log files from 189 patients. Each patient received an HVAD (HeartWare). The log files contain on average 3000 power values collected over a period of appx. 31 days. None of the analyzed log files contained serious complications, such as a pump thrombosis. Results: To show a significant difference between the power values of the daytime (8 am-10 pm) and the night-time, a statistical test (significance level: 5%) was carried out. 813 of 840 log files showed a significant difference (average t = 16.94). In addition, the average difference between the maximum and the minimum power value of a day was calculated for each day (average: 1071.9mW, SD: 158.2mW, range: 497.1mW - 2299.5mW). Furthermore, the average power was calculated for each day and log file. To get a measure for the fluctuation in daily average of power development within a log file, the SD has been calculated (SD average: 65.3mW, range 10.4mW - 435.9mW). Discussion: The retrospective analysis of LVAD log files shows that power behavior is individual. Although most patients show a significant power difference between daytime and night-time hours, the maximum difference of a day and the average power changes over several days varies from patient to patient. A patient-specific power model, considering the circadian rhythm, was developed and applied to our thrombosis detection algorithms, which achieved a better thrombosis detection time of up to 93 hours compared to the LVAD controller alarming algorithm. Objectives: Suppression of membrane fouling is an important key technology for the development of portable and implantable artificial kidneys. Among several factors known to affect membrane fouling, we focused on the blood flow condition. In the present study, to clarify the effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile blood flow on membrane fouling, an ex vivo hemofiltration experiment using porcine blood was carried out. Methods: Hemofiltration with filtrate recycling was performed under three conditions; pulsatile flow using a roller pump, non-pulsatile flow using a roller pump with three chambers to stabilize the flow, and non-pulsatile flow using a centrifugal pump. The blood flow rate (QB) was set at 50 or 100 mL/min and the maximum filtration rate at which irreversible membrane fouling would not occur was determined as follows; the first filtration rate (QF) was set at 2.5% of the QB for one hour (baseline), increased by 2.5% to 5% of the QB for one hour, and then returned to the baseline value for 20 min, and the transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured to check if it had returned to the baseline value. This step was repeated until the QF reached 25% of the QB. Results: For both blood flow rates (50 and 100 mL/min), the maximum filtration flow rate at which the TMP did not return to the baseline, implying that irreversible membrane fouling had occurred, was higher under the non-pulsatile flow conditions than under the pulsatile flow condition. Discussion: The flow rate and the TMP changed periodically under the pulsatile flow condition and the peak TMP value was higher than that under the non-pulsatile flow condition, which increases the burden on the membrane. Thus, there is an increased likelihood of membrane fouling, as compared to the constant the pressure under the non-pulsatile flow condition. Objectives: The objective is to develop a simulator of the anatomy and hemodynamics of the radial artery in order to design a robust controller for a noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement method. Currently, blood pressure, in intensive care units, is measured invasively, which can lead to complications (e.g. infections). The novel approach facilitates a continuous noninvasive flow measurement, in addition to the instantaneous blood pressure measurement. Methods: During measurements, a controller pneumatically adjusts the pressure in a balloon, positioned on top of the radial artery, so that the Doppler derived flow in the radial artery is reduced to a constant target value. The resulting pressure in the balloon correlates with the blood pressure. For the development of this method, a simulator, modelling the anatomical conditions of the lower arm, was constructed. The simulator was designed to create arbitrary physiological pressure curves. For the validation of the simulator, invasively measured blood pressure curves and data found in literature related to the mass flow rates were compared to the curves created by the simulator. Results: The pressure curve, created with the simulator, shows a deviation of less than 5 % to the invasively measured blood pressure. The mass flow rate shows a good agreement with the literature data. The simulator is capable of simulating blood pressure curves with a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg to 120 mmHg. First tests with the controller have shown that it is possible to control the pulsatile flow to the constant target flow rate. Discussion: Regarding the simulator, the next step is to adjust it, so that it can simulate flows above a mean pressure of 120 mmHg. Regarding the controller, stress tests must be conducted. It must be evaluated whether it is robust enough to work with pressure curves that fluctuate in mean pressure and frequency. Objectives: Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during haemodialysis are typically estimated from variations in haematocrit, haemoglobin or total blood protein measured by optical, acoustic or other sensors integrated in the dialysis circuit. Due to dynamic changes in the circulation during the initial phase of dialysis (following filling of the extracorporeal circuit with the patient's blood and starting dialyzer ultrafiltration), the indications of RBV monitors depend on the exact moment of starting RBV measurements. The aim of this study was to assess this issue quantitatively using a mathematical modelling approach. Methods: The developed compartmental model describes the flow of blood across the cardiovascular system and the extracorporeal circuit combined with the whole-body transport of water and the most important osmotically active solutes and the baroreflex mechanisms. The model was validated using clinical data from patients on maintenance HD. A standard 4-hour HD session with 3 L ultrafiltration was studied for a virtual reference patient with all model parameters based on the literature data. RBV changes were derived from the simulated haematocrit (HCT) changes. Two cases were analysed: the priming saline being infused to the patient or discarded. Results: For the case when the priming saline was infused to the patient, the total RBV reduction at the end of the simulated dialysis session varied between 8 % (when HCT changes were monitored from the very beginning of dialysis) and 13 % (when HCT monitoring was started circa 4 minutes later). For the case when the priming saline was discarded, the analogous difference in RBV reduction was less than 1 percentage point. Discussion: When the priming saline is infused to the patient, a few minute difference in the moment of starting RBV measurements may significantly affect the indicated RBV changes, which is due to the dilution of blood by the infused saline and the time it takes for the uniform mixing of blood across the circulatory system. We have developed autologous in vivo tissue engineered vascular grafts (in vivo TEVG, i.e. BIOTUBE) mainly composed of fibroblasts and collagen constructed in the patients' subcutaneous tissues. After long term animal experiments over 5 years, we clinically applied them to the congenital heart surgery of a 2-year-old child as a pulmonary artery patch plasty material in 2015. Three years after implantation, 3D-CT exhibited neither aneurysmal dilatation, significant calcification, nor shrinkage of the patch graft interfering the growth of the pulmonary artery. The clinical course was good without any significant complications over 4 years presently. However, since the tissue formation largely depends on the regenerative ability of the host, individual differences exist, and it is an issue to secure the mechanical reliability of the grafts formed in high-risk patients. We are currently evaluating the changes in mechanical properties of TEVGs by chemical treatment, and are examining whether it is possible to improve mechanical durability. In addition, in order to fabricate the TEVGs in healthy individuals as allogeneic (parents) or xenogeneic tissue substitutes, we are conducting transplantation experiments on decellularized tissues. The in vivo TEVGs could also be applied to AV-shunts. However, in the animal pilot experiments, significant stenosis was observed at the anastomosis with host vein resulting in early occlusion probably because of high sheer stresses. The attempts to overcome the problems by several investigators are also reviewed. Objectives: To evaluate different designs or insertion techniques of cochlear implant electrode carriers (ECs) insertion forces are measured by a force sensor, which is mounted directly underneath an artificial cochlea model (aCM) leading to a summed force profile. One of the next steps in CI research leads from post-experimental evaluation of measured insertion force profiles to pre-experimental predictions of these profiles using analytical models based on an improved knowledge about factors impacting the insertion forces. Three likely factors were chosen for further investigation: speed, EC stiffness and curvature of the aCM. Methods: Three aCM were fabricated out of PTFE blocks, each model having one constant curvature (r = 6.4 / 8.5 / 12.7 mm). Additionally EC substitutes were fabricated using a two-component silicone, all with a constant diameter (0.7 mm), a total length of 20.5 mm and embedded bare copper wires. In order to vary the stiffness of the EC substitutes, one type had four and the other six wires embedded. They were inserted into the aCM with three different insertion speeds ( v = 0.11 / 0.4 / 1.6 mm/s). In order to increase reproducibility, insertions were conducted using an automated insertion test bench, comprising a linear actuator to clamp the EC substitutes and move them into the aCM and the force sensor underneath the model. Results: In accordance with theoretical considerations all varied factors showed effects on the insertion force profiles. Increased insertion speed and sample stiffness increased the insertion forces, whereas an increased model radius decreased the insertion forces. Discussion: The variance of measured forces within one set of parameters is due to the manual fabrication of samples and may be decreased by usage of commercial ECs. The influence of lubricants has to be analysed within future experiments. Objectives: The purpose of this work is to design and create a high efficiency inductive powering unit (IPU) for a wide range of implantable devices and artificial organs (AO). Methods: A possible way to realize wireless powering is to use inductive energy transfer systems. To maximize overall system efficiency class E power amplifier is widely used due to its 100% efficiency in the ideal case. But maximum efficiency can be achieved only if input and output system parameters will remain constant during IPU operation. Inductive coils have nonzero distance between them because of patient's tissue thickness. It is worth noting that tissue thickness is different for every patient: the difference may be several millimeters. Moreover, this value can change during IPU operation as a result of patient's motor activity or tissue edema which will lead to PA detuning and decreasing efficiency. To avoid PA's detuning, frequency tuning systems can be used. There are two approaches for tuning systems that can be found in the literature. The first uses voltage and/or current levels of important circuit nodes to estimate system status. This method is good and quite simple, but requires external control signals that means additional power losses and decreased efficiency. The other method uses the phase of the voltage signals from important nodes and consumes less power. The second method was chosen by authors to design a tuning system. Results: During this work, a calculation method for PA and the frequency tuning system were designed. The experimental prototype was created. The authors of this article obtained an overall system efficiency of more than 60 % for three different coil sets and output power from 0.7 W to 1 W for same coil sets and range of axial misalignments from 10 to 20 mm. Discussion: The high efficiency inductive powering system for AO has been designed and tested during this work. Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis (HD), but it still fails in more than 40% cases within the first year. Stenosis is the main cause of AVF failure, but its detection and prediction are still open clinical challenges. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential of using sound analysis to reveal unique characteristics in AVF sounds and to detect potentially relevant changes over time. Methods: We acquired the sounds of 10 AVFs, 7 referred by the nephrologists as well-functioning and 3 as stenotic AVFs. We also acquired the sound of 1 AVF characterized by severe stenosis and we repeated the recording after surgical revision. Sounds were recorded using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200 using wide mode. Sounds were transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop and frequency spectra were obtained using an in-house Matlab code embedding the Fast Fourier Transform and a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, aimed at attenuating stethoscope's noise and heart sounds' frequencies. Results: In well-functioning AVFs we consistently found a low-frequency peak, located in the bandwidth 100-200 Hz, while no relevant spectral features were present at higher frequencies. On the other hand, stenotic AVFs showed high-frequency peaks, located in the bandwidth of 500-600 Hz. In the AVF with severe stenosis we found high-frequency peaks in the bandwidth 700-750 Hz, which were replaced by low-frequency peaks after AVF revision. Discussion: Sound analysis revealed unique characteristics in the frequency spectra of AVFs, allowing an objective discrimination between well-functioning and stenotic AVFs. This technique may bring the advantage of limiting clinician's skill-dependency and personal interpretation. Despite being preliminary, our results suggest that sound analysis may be used to detect stenosis development and allow patients' self-monitoring, resulting in early prediction of AVF failure. Objectives: Biofilms on percutaneous leads of implanted blood pumps can cause severe infections. By treating infections with antibiotics over a long period of time, bacteria develop resistance. Today, in a clinical setting, antibiotic resistance is determined in-vitro for all available drugs. The aim of the EvolChip project is to predict the probabilities of resistances that might evolve and suggest combinations of antibiotics that slow down or even prevent future resistance. Methods: The EvolChip reactor consists of an agar plate that serves as a diffusion and growth medium. Three membranes permit diffusion of active substances from microfluidic channels into the agar medium. Two of these channels serve as sources for different antibiotics, the third one as the sink. As a result, two overlapping drug gradients establish, with a low concentration near the sink and high concentration close to the sources. Antibiotics were mixed with a nutrient solution to promote bacteria migration towards higher concentrated areas. The bacteria contain a green fluorescent protein gene, which enables real-time tracking via polarisation filters and a camera. Results: In preliminary experiments, the gradient course could be characterized by making use of fluorescent markers. Only resistant bacteria migrated towards the sources with high antibiotic concentration. The spatial distribution of bacteria facilitates the identification of optimal concentration ratios and mixtures of antibiotics. In addition, the speed of resistance evolution with respect to different antibiotic mixtures was determined. Discussion: The proposed EvolChip concept showed promising results in preliminary experiments. Further geometries, growth media, and bacteria will be tested. In order to validate the method, patient strains with known treatment and resistance history will be compared to the predictions of the presented method. Objectives: Due to the growing demand for organs in liver transplantation, techniques for optimization of suboptimal livers are needed such as normotermic liver perfusion (PNT). In this way, hepatic repercussion of ischaemic preconditioning (PI) still remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the haemodynamic and biochemical alterations produced after intraoperative PI on livers subjected to 6 hours of PNT. As a secondary objective, we aim to determine the effect of PI on liver function. Methods: Eight minipig livers, randomized to control (n=4) and PI group (n=4), were perfused during six hours in a PNT circuit (34oC). The PI group was subjected to 10 minutes of ischaemia by means of a Pringle manoeuvrein the hepatic hilum, followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. Biochemical and gasometric parameters were measured at baseline and hourly in perfusate. Pressures and flows in hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) were registered. For statistical analysis Spearman's rho test and Mann-Whitney U test was performed, considering p < 0,05 as significant. Results: There were significant differences in HA flow, adjusted to weight, doubling the control group (PI 0,42 +/- 0,17 ml/min/g Vs GC 0,17 +/- 0,05 ml/min/g; p=0,000); no differences were found in PV flow. Total proteins (PI 1,9 [1,7-2]g/dL Vs GC 1,3 [0,95-1,5]g/dL; p=0,000) and O-2 consumption rate (PI 0,086 [0,055-0,113] ml/min/g Vs GC 0,040 [0,017-0,060]ml/min/g; p=0,000)were significantly increased in the PI group. There were no significant differences in AST, ALT, or GGT. Discussion: The PI, as a previous maneuver to PNT, increases hepatic artery flow and O2 consumption without altering citolytic parameters in liver. This may improve hepatic functionality as a previous step in transplantation. Further molecular and histological study should be made to clarify our finding in PI on PNT.",

            "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently under investigation as a promising technique for enhancement of athletic performance through modulating cortical excitability. Through consecutive randomization, 12 experienced bodybuilders were randomly assigned to two arms receiving either sham or real tDCS over the primary motor cortex (leg area) and left temporal cortex (T3) for 13 minutes in the first session. After 72 hours, both groups received the inverse stimulation. After the brain stimulation, cerebral hemodynamic response (using frontopolar hemoencephalography) was examined upon taking three computer-based cognitive tasks i.e. reasoning, memory and verbal ability using the Cambridge Brain Science-Cognitive Platform. Subsequently, the bodybuilders performed knee extension exercise while performance indicators including one-repetition maximum (1RM), muscular endurance (SEI), heart rate (ECG), motivation (VAS), surface electromyography over quadriceps femoris muscle (sEMG) and perceived exertion (RPE) were evaluated. The real tDCS vs. sham group showed decreased RPE and HR mean scores by 14.2% and 4.9%, respectively. Regarding muscular strength, endurance, and electrical activity, the 1RM, SEI, and sEMG factors improved by 4.4%, 16.9%, and % 5.8, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to sham, real tDCS did not affect the athletes' motivation. Incidentally, it turned out that subjects who underwent T3 anodal stimulation outperformed in memory (p = 0.02) and verbal functions (0.02) as well as their corresponding frontopolar hemodynamic response [(memory HEG (p = 0.001) and verbal HEG (p = 0.003)]. Our findings suggest that simultaneous tDCS-induced excitation over the M1 leg area and left temporal area may potentially improve the overall athletic performance in experienced bodybuilders.",

            "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly important in the architecture and engineering fields, and especially in the field of sustainability through the study of energy. This study performs a bibliometric study analysis of BIM publications based on the Scopus database during the whole period from 2003 to 2018. The aim was to establish a comparison of bibliometric maps of the building information model and BIM in universities. The analyzed data included 4307 records produced by a total of 10,636 distinct authors from 314 institutions. Engineering and computer science were found to be the main scientific fields involved in BIM research. Architectural design are the central theme keywords, followed by information theory and construction industry. The final stage of the study focuses on the detection of clusters in which global research in this field is grouped. The main clusters found were those related to the BIM cycle, including construction management, documentation and analysis, architecture and design, construction/fabrication, and operation and maintenance (related to energy or sustainability). However, the clusters of the last phases such as demolition and renovation are not present, which indicates that this field suntil needs to be further developed and researched. With regard to the evolution of research, it has been observed how information technologies have been integrated over the entire spectrum of internet of things (IoT). A final key factor in the implementation of the BIM is its inclusion in the curriculum of technical careers related to areas of construction such as civil engineering or architecture.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the use of services for Open Systems development has consolidated and strengthened. Advances in the Service Science and Engineering (SSE) community, promoted by the reinforcement of Web Services and Semantic Web technologies and the presence of new Cloud computing techniques, such as the proliferation of microservices solutions, have allowed software architects to experiment and develop new ways of building open and adaptable computer systems at runtime. Home automation, intelligent buildings, robotics, graphical user interfaces are some of the social atmosphere environments suitable in which to apply certain innovative trends.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In this era of big data, as the data size is scaling up, the need for computing power is exponentially increasing. However, most of the community detection algorithms in the literature are classified as global algorithms, which require access to the entire information of the network. These algorithms designed to work on a single machine cannot be directly parallelized. Hence, it is impossible for such algorithms working in stand-alone machines to find communities in large-scale networks and also the required processing power far exceeds the processing capabilities of single machines. In this paper, a set of novel Decentralized Iterative Community Clustering Approaches to extract an efficient community structure for large networks are proposed and devalued using the LFR benchmark model. The approaches have the ability to identify the community clusters from the entire network without global knowledge of the network topology and will work with a range of computer architecture platforms (e.g., cluster of PCs, multi-core distributed memory servers, GPUs). Detecting and characterizing such community structures is one of the fundamental topics in network systems' analysis, and it has many important applications in different branches of science including computer science, physics, mathematics and biology ranging from visualization, exploratory and data mining to building prediction models.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The description of the new contact mechanism between dissimilar materials during joint plastic deformation is proposed in this paper. To analyze the process of joint deformation of composite material layers, a multi-stage analytical model was developed based on the study of the contact interaction between the surfaces of the materials to be bonded using the slip line method. When mathematical simulation of the process of joint deformation of dissimilar materials, the influence of the geometrical surface profile of a harder layer of a composite, as a more significant factor, was estimated. For the entire range of influence of the investigated geometrical surface profile of a harder material of a composite, the final forming and stress state parameters in its intermediate zone were determined. To verify the analytical model, computer simulation of the process of joint deformation of composite material layers by the finite element method in two-dimensional formulation was carried out. The comparison of both solutions has confirmed the adequacy of the results obtained in the mathematical simulation. The theoretical model can be used in the development of bonding mechanisms between dissimilar materials, in the development of manufacturing technologies of new clad composite materials, as well as in the analysis and improvement of the existing manufacturing technologies of clad composite materials.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Aim of the study: Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to offer a novel approach to CPR training that supplements conventional training methods with gamification and a more interactive learning experience. This is done through computer-generated imagery superimposed on users' view of the real environment to simulate interactive training scenarios. We sought to test the feasibility of an AR CPR training system (CPReality) for health care providers (HCPs). Methods: In this feasibility trial, a CPR training manikin was integrated with a commercial AR device (Microsoft HoloLens) to provide participants with real-time audio-visual feedback via a holographic overlay of blood flow to vital organs dependent on CC quality. In this system, higher quality CC visually improved virtual blood circulation. HCPs performed a 2-minute cycle of hands-only CPR using only the AR system, and CC parameters were recorded. Descriptive data on participants' demographics, CC quality, and satisfaction with the training environment were reported using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Between 10/2018-11/2018, we enrolled a convenience sample of 51 HCPs. The median age of participants was 31 years (IQR 27-41), 71% (36/51) were female, and 67% (34/51) were registered nurses. CC rates (mean 126 +/- 12.9 cpm), depths (median 53 mm, IQR 46-58), and percent with complete recoil (median 80%, IQR 12-100) were consistent with guideline recommendations for good quality CPR. Participants were predominantly satisfied with the system, with 82% perceiving the experience as realistic, 98% recognizing the visualizations as helpful for training, and 94% willing to use the application in future CPR training. Conclusions: As AR is increasingly applied in the healthcare setting, integration in CPR training offers a novel and promising educational approach. In this convenience sample of trained HCPs, high quality CC delivery was feasible using the AR CPR training system which was received favorably by most participants.",

The last government (2014-2018) took different actions to explain how the use of data science and open data improve the business activity. The question to identify if there is a relationship between IT capacities, the organizational structure and the performance of the companies remains unresolved and is certainly an urgent issue for new government of Ivan Duque. Purpose: Our study analyses the relationship between data structure and business performance measured through the efficiency of customer experience and provider operations processes. Methodology: our methodology is novel compared to previous researches which develop linear regression. It is based on the use of a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Originality/value: our method allows to reveal multiple and complementary paths to achieve possible correlations between data and business performance. Findings: Our results show that data consistency, data usage and data protection are the three more frequent conditions to a better customer experience and provider operations efficiency. Surprisingly, data-driven profile is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Practical implications: our conclusions allow practitioners to uncover the strength of the data to orientate their digital strategy. Our recommendations could be used for the new governmental program of digital revival for Small and Medium Enterprises.",

The main contribution of this paper is to extract temporal association patterns of energy consumption at appliance level. The proposed approach extends the Utility-oriented Temporal Association Rules Mining (UTARM) algorithm to discover appliances usage preference at a time.

            "title": "Vision-based lane departure warning framework",
            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Collisions arising from lane departures have contributed to traffic accidents causing millions of injuries and tens of thousands of casualties per year worldwide. Many related studies had shown that single vehicle lane departure crashes accounted largely in road traffic deaths that results from drifting out of the roadway. Hence, automotive safety has becoming a concern for the road users as most of the road casualties occurred due to driver's fallacious judgement of vehicle path. This paper proposes a vision-based lane departure warning framework for lane departure detection under daytime and night-time driving environments. The traffic flow and conditions of the road surface for both urban roads and highways in the city of Malacca are analysed in terms of lane detection rate and false positive rate. The proposed vision-based lane departure warning framework includes lane detection followed by a computation of a lateral offset ratio. The lane detection is composed of two stages: pre-processing and detection. In the pre-processing, a colour space conversion, region of interest extraction, and lane marking segmentation are carried out. In the subsequent detection stage, Hough transform is used to detect lanes. Lastly, the lateral offset ratio is computed to yield a lane departure warning based on the detected X-coordinates of the bottom end-points of each lane boundary in the image plane. For lane detection and lane departure detection performance evaluation, real-life datasets for both urban roads and highways in daytime and night-time driving environments, traffic flows, and road surface conditions are considered. The experimental results show that the proposed framework yields satisfactory results. On average, detection rates of 94.71% for lane detection rate and 81.18% for lane departure detection rate were achieved using the proposed frameworks. In addition, benchmark lane marking segmentation methods and Caltech lanes dataset were also considered for comparison evaluation in lane detection. Challenges to lane detection and lane departure detection such as worn lane markings, low illumination, arrow signs, and occluded lane markings are highlighted as the contributors to the false positive rates.",

The deformation and bending moment in cut off wall are a their lowest magnitude when the cut off wall is positioned at upstream end. The cut off wall is subjected to second lowest deformation, when it is positioned at downstream end. The maximum deformation occurs, when the cut off wall is positioned at 0.60 times the total width of diversion dam from upstream end. The seepage rate in the diversion dam is highest when the cut off wall is positioned at centre of the diversion dam. The seepage rate in the diversion dam is having direct relation with the maximum displacement and maximum bending moment. The seepage force found to be more predominant than the pressure gradient and active pore pressure variations in deforming the cut off walls of diversion dams.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In recent years, a variety of research fields, including finance, have begun to place great emphasis on machine learning techniques because they exhibit broad abilities to simulate more complicated problems. In contrast to the traditional linear regression scheme that is usually used to describe the relationship between the stock forward return and company characteristics, the field of finance has experienced the rapid development of tree-based algorithms and neural network paradigms when illustrating complex stock dynamics. These nonlinear methods have proved to be effective in predicting stock prices and selecting stocks that can outperform the general market. This article implements and evaluates the robustness of the random forest (RF) model in the context of the stock selection strategy. The model is trained for stocks in the Chinese stock market, and two types of feature spaces, fundamental/technical feature space and pure momentum feature space, are adopted to forecast the price trend in the long run and the short run, respectively. It is evidenced that both feature paradigms have led to remarkable excess returns during the past five out-of-sample period years, with the Sharpe ratios calculated to be 2.75 and 5 for the portfolio net value of the multi-factor space strategy and momentum space strategy, respectively. Although the excess return has weakened in recent years with respect to the multi-factor strategy, our findings point to a less efficient market that is far from equilibrium.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In this work, a rasterized mesh construction of our 3D solid-state model is generated to achieve an improved rasterization of a rigid-body surface using a series of polygonal model transfers. In the field of remodeling, auxiliary starters have been obtained from either ready-made or fabricated input point datasets. Building 3D solid meshes from clusters of inbound points to model objects is made possible by our method. Demonstrative illustrations of how the initial series of points can be transferred to mesh models by passing through the boundary conditions are presented using a customized method. A handmade weaving technique combines each different cluster of points, yielding a relevant transformation result. Additionally, newer remodeling methods involve more than the adaptation of boundary values to generate solid surfaces via finite restructuring of geometrical building blocks; our remodeling methods have been optimized in terms of both realism and computational costs. Our reconstructions are highly optimized to achieve high-quality and realistic results within a reasonable time. In higher-order creative restorations, our boundary conditions are regularized by quadratic equalizer functions. Areal-based regularizations are combined within mixed boundary values over 3D multigrids of finite differential combinations. Newly created solid models are reshaped by exclusive reconstructions to form our final models. Equally distributed multidimensional grids are seamlessly rebuilt via an ideal model-driven process with our tri-variational remodeling method that is constrained by a mixture of boundary conditions. Here, our remodeling method continuously triangulates the discrete topological structures as solid models. The final model shapes are triangulated as a consequence of postpolygonization by our unique reconstructors. An exact solution can be obtained via a convex hulling process on the preliminary finite fields by means of high-resolution configurations. Our 3D remodeling method using solid-state tessellation has opened the field to wider ranges of complete-gridding plans to achieve matchless enriched reformation capability, which makes our new solidification remeshing of models better than the majority of currently available methods.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: Secondary usage of patient data has recently become of increasing interest for the development and application of computer analytic techniques. Strict oversight of these data is required and the individual patients themselves are integral to providing guidance. We sought to understand patients' attitudes to sharing their imaging data for research purposes. These images could provide a great wealth of information for researchers. Methods: Patients from the Greater Toronto Area attending Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre for imaging (magnetic resonance imagining, computed tomography, or ultrasound) examination areas were invited to participate in an electronic survey. Results: Of the 1083 patients who were approached (computed tomography 609, ultrasound 314, and magnetic resonance imaging 160), 798 (74%) agreed to take the survey. Overall median age was 60 (interquartile range = 18, Q1 = 52, Q3 = 70), 52% were women, 42% had a university degree, and 7% had no high school diploma. In terms of willingness to share de-identified medical images for research, 76% were willing (agreed and strongly agreed), while 7% refused. Most participants gave their family physicians (73%) and other physicians (57%) unconditional data access. Participants chose hospitals/research institutions to regulate electronic images databases (70%), 89% wanted safeguards against unauthorized access to their data, and over 70% wanted control over who will be permitted, for how long, and the ability to revoke that permission. Conclusions: Our study found that people are willing to share their clinically acquired de-identified medical images for research studies provided that they have control over permissions and duration of access.

            "abstract": "This paper proposes two novel measures to study the geographic mobility of faculty members from their graduating institutions in the United States: a continuous measure using geographic distance and a discrete one concerning the concept of Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The joint application of the two novel measures to a hand-collected hiring network dataset including more than 15,000 faculty members in three disparate disciplines (business, computer science, and history) leads to interesting findings regarding geographic mobility of American professors from graduating institutions, defined by relocation distance or cross-MSA from the PhD granting institution and the hiring institution. Overall, American faculty exhibits high geographic mobility from their graduating institutions in terms of relocation distance and cross-MSA moves. History faculty members have the highest mobility while those in business show the lowest mobility. We further find that assistant professors show the highest mobility while full professors show lowest mobility. In addition, while there is little distance difference between male and female faculty members overall, female faculty members are less likely to move between MSAs or regions in the United States.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition, especially large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, is an important issue in the field of machine learning. For a long time, the hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixed model (GMM) has been the mainstream speech recognition framework. But recently, HMM-deep neural network (DNN) model and the end-to-end model using deep learning has achieved performance beyond HMM-GMM. Both using deep learning techniques, these two models have comparable performances. However, the HMM-DNN model itself is limited by various unfavorable factors such as data forced segmentation alignment, independent hypothesis, and multi-module individual training inherited from HMM, while the end-to-end model has a simplified model, joint training, direct output, no need to force data alignment and other advantages. Therefore, the end-to-end model is an important research direction of speech recognition. In this paper we review the development of end-to-end model. This paper first introduces the basic ideas, advantages and disadvantages of HMM-based model and end-to-end models, and points out that end-to-end model is the development direction of speech recognition. Then the article focuses on the principles, progress and research hotspots of three different end-to-end models, which are connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based, recurrent neural network (RNN)-transducer and attention-based, and makes theoretically and experimentally detailed comparisons. Their respective advantages and disadvantages and the possible future development of the end-to-end model are finally pointed out. Automatic speech recognition is a pattern recognition task in the field of computer science, which is a subject area of Symmetry.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Accelerometer calibration for physical activity (PA) intensity is commonly performed using Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) as criterion. However, MET is not an age-equivalent measure of PA intensity, which limits the use of MET-calibrated accelerometers for age-related PA investigations. We investigated calibration using VO2net (VO2gross - VO2stand; mL.min(-1).kg(-1)) as criterion compared to MET (VO2gross/VO2rest) and the effect on assessment of free-living PA in children, adolescents and adults. Oxygen consumption and hip/thigh accelerometer data were collected during rest, stand and treadmill walk and run. Equivalent speed (Speed(eq)) was used as indicator of the absolute speed (Speed(abs)) performed with the same effort in individuals of different body size/age. The results showed that VO2net was higher in younger age-groups for Speedabs, but was similar in the three age-groups for Speed(eq). MET was lower in younger age-groups for both Speed(abs) and Speed(eq). The same VO2net-values respective MET-values were applied to all age-groups to develop accelerometer PA intensity cut-points. Free-living moderate-and-vigorous PA was 216, 115, 74 and 71 min/d in children, adolescents, younger and older adults with VO2net-calibration, but 140, 83, 74 and 41 min/d with MET-calibration, respectively. In conclusion, VO2net calibration of accelerometers may provide age-equivalent measures of PA intensity/effort for more accurate age-related investigations of PA in epidemiological research.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Nowadays, the amount of digitally available information has tremendously grown, with real-world data graphs outreaching the millions or even billions of vertices. Hence, community detection, where groups of vertices are formed according to a well-defined similarity measure, has never been more essential affecting a vast range of scientific fields such as bio-informatics, sociology, discrete mathematics, nonlinear dynamics, digital marketing, and computer science. Even if an impressive amount of research has yet been published to tackle this NP-hard class problem, the existing methods and algorithms have virtually been proven inefficient and severely unscalable. In this regard, the purpose of this manuscript is to combine the network topology properties expressed by the loose similarity and the local edge betweenness, which is a currently proposed Girvan-Newman's edge betweenness measure alternative, along with the intrinsic user content information, in order to introduce a novel and highly distributed hybrid community detection methodology. The proposed approach has been thoroughly tested on various real social graphs, roundly compared to other classic divisive community detection algorithms that serve as baselines and practically proven exceptionally scalable, highly efficient, and adequately accurate in terms of revealing the subjacent network hierarchy.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "People tend to like stimuli-ranging from human faces to text-that are prototypical, and thus easily processed. However, recent research has suggested that less typical stimuli may be preferred in creative contexts, such as fine art or music lyrics. In an archival sample of movie scripts, we tested whether genre-typicality predicted film ratings as a function of rater role (novice audience member or expert film critic). Genre-typicality was operationalized as the profile correlations between linguistic arcs (across five segments, or acts) for each script and within-genre averages. We predicted (1) that critics would prefer more disfluent (genre-atypical) films and general audiences would prefer fluent (genre-typical) films, and (2) that these differences would be most pronounced for genres expected to be more entertaining (e.g., action/adventure) than challenging (e.g., tragedy). Partly consistent with our hypotheses, the results showed that critics gave higher ratings to action/adventure films with less typical positive emotion arcs. However, regardless of audience-member or professional-critic status, higher ratings were attributed to films that were more genre-atypical (or disfluent), in terms of analytic thinking, narrative action, and emotional tone, across all genres except family/kids films. Such findings support the growing literature on the appeal of disfluency in the arts and have relevance for researchers in psychology and computer science who are interested in computational linguistic approaches to attitudes, film, and literature.",

Any study that can be run on a computer or mobile device can be run with nearly any demographic anywhere in the world, and in large numbers. This has allowed scientists to effectively run hundreds of experiments at once. Despite their transformative power, such studies remain rare for practical reasons: the need for sophisticated software, the difficulty of recruiting so many subjects, and a lack of research paradigms that make effective use of their large amounts of data, due to such realities as that they require sophisticated software in order to run effectively. We present Pushkin: an open-source platform for designing and conducting massive experiments over the internet. Pushkin allows for a wide range of behavioral paradigms, through integration with the intuitive and flexible jsPsych experiment engine. It also addresses the basic technical challenges associated with massive, worldwide studies, including auto-scaling, extensibility, machine-assisted experimental design, multisession studies, and data security.",

A regularly present, but less known creator of R&D innovations is the intelligence community. To understand the role and impact of defense and intelligence-related research for driving ICT innovations, we analyzed which technological paradigms were promoted by US defense and intelligence agencies and the development of these research trajectories over time. Using bibliographic analysis, we clustered 82,239 scientific papers funded by the US national security system, published between 2009-2017, in research fronts, and after that aggregated the research fronts into technological paradigms. Our analysis identified main technological paradigms promoted by the US defense's sectoral system of innovation, such as quantum science and graphene as fields that could generate high impact in the new generation of radical technologies. The efforts of intelligence agencies was highly concentrated on quantum science, social forecasting, computer cognition and signal processing. Our research highlights the role of US security players in shaping research fields.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches. This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption. SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets. As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data of an heating distribution network and power consumption data collected in a major Italian city. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of buildings.",

            "abstract": "The aim of the study was to develop an effective method of teaching computer graphics using information models. The authors conducted a pedagogical experiment, which consisted of two stages: ascertaining and teaching. The experiment involved 30 students and teachers in computer science. At the ascertaining stage, the state of students' practical knowledge and skills in computer graphics was analyzed. The authors had the following tasks at the first stage: to develop and describe the components, evaluation criteria and development levels of the motivation for studying computer graphics; design a diagnostic complex aimed at studying the development of the main components of the motivation for studying computer graphics; to identify the features of the development of the main components and levels of motivation for studying computer graphics in traditional learning environments. The teaching stage allowed to check the effectiveness of the task system developed by the authors, as well as the author's methodology of using information modeling in computer graphics. In order to test the accuracy of experimental learning, the authors used the method of comparing the level of mastering the educational material of students in the control and experimental classes and the probabilistic method. For this purpose, control tests were conducted, the results of which were subjected to qualitative analysis. The results of the pedagogical experiment indicated the effectiveness of the proposed method of using computer information modeling in teaching computer graphics.

Recycling computers, which still work but no longer deliver the performance expected for their primary functions, is an interesting way to extend the life of electronics.

The quality and quantity of software available on the internet for the visualization of the obtained spectra is high. The simplified optical system has limitations but maintains sufficient quality to be used as a didactic tool. Improvements that can be made to this equipment include, but are not limited to, inclusion of a more suitable optical system with a focal lens array, more defined diffraction grating, and replacement of the imaging system with a filterless system.

            "abstract": "Adjoint methods have become fundamental ingredients of the scientific computing toolbox over the past decades. Large-scale parameter sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and nonlinear optimization would otherwise turn out computationally infeasible. The symbolic derivation of adjoint mathematical models for relevant problems in science and engineering and their implementation in consistency with the implementation of the underlying primal model frequently proves highly challenging. Hence, an increased interest in algorithmic adjoints can be observed. The algorithmic derivation of adjoint numerical simulation programs shifts some of the problems faced from functional and numerical analysis to computer science. It becomes a highly complex software engineering task requiring expertise in software analysis, transformation, and optimization. Despite rather mature software tool support for algorithmic differentiation, substantial user intervention is typically required when targeting nontrivial numerical programs. A large number of patterns shared by numerous application codes results in repeated duplication of development effort. The adjoint code design patterns introduced in this article aim to reduce this problem through improved formalization from the software engineering perspective. Fully functional reference implementations are provided through github.",

However, many factors and processes can affect planetary habitability and must be understood to accurately determine a planet's habitability potential. While climate models have long been used to understand and predict climate and weather patterns on the Earth, a growing community of researchers has begun to apply these models to extrasolar planets. This work has provided a better understanding of how orbital, surface, and atmospheric properties affect planetary climate and habitability; how these climatic effects might change for different stellar and planetary environments; and how the habitability and observational signatures of newly discovered planets might be influenced by these climatic factors. This review summarizes the origins and evolution of the burgeoning field of exoplanet climatology, discusses recent work using a hierarchy of computer models to identify those planets most capable of supporting life, and offers a glimpse into future directions of this quickly evolving subfield of exoplanet science.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Pig counting is one of the most critical topics in farming management and asset estimation. Due to its complexity, traditional agriculture method relies on manual counting, which is obviously inefficient and a waste of manpower. The challenging aspects like partial occlusion, overlapping and different perspectives even limit the usage of traditional computer vision techniques. In recent years, deep learning has become more and more popular for computer vision applications, because of its superior performance comparing to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep learning solution to address the pig counting problem. We present a modified Counting Convolutional Neural Network (Counting CNN) model according to the structure of ResNeXt, and tune a series of experimental parameters. Our CNN model learns the mapping from the image feature to the density map, and obtains the total number of pigs in the entire image by integrating the density map. In order to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset collected from actual piggery farming with 15 pigs in an image averagely. We achieve 1.67 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per image and outperforms the competing algorithms, which strongly demonstrates that our proposed method can accurately estimate the number of pigs even if they are partially occluded in different perspectives. The detection speed, 42 ms per image, meets the requirements of agricultural application. We share our code and the first pig dataset we collected for pig counting at https://github.com/xixiareone/counting-pigs for livestock husbandry and science research community.",

            "abstract": "K-12 classroom settings are not yet incorporating emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, nor even touch surfaces, despite the significant impact that such media have made in many other aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students' physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research.",

This perspective, proposed by Miroslav Fiedler, introduces techniques from (simplex) geometry into the field of graph theory and conversely, via an exact correspondence. We introduce this graph-simplex correspondence, identify a number of basic connections between graph characteristics and simplex properties, and suggest some applications as example.",

            "abstract": "Communicability functions quantify the flow of information between two nodes of a network. In this work, we use them to explore the concept of the influence of a paper in a citation network. These functions depend on a parameter. By varying the parameter in a continuous way we explore different definitions of influence. We study six citation networks, three from physics and three from computer science. As a benchmark, we compare our results against two frequently used measures: the number of citations of a paper and the PageRank algorithm. We show that the ranking of the articles in a network can be varied from being equivalent to the ranking obtained from the number of citations to a behaviour tending to the eigenvector centrality, these limits correspond to small and large values of the communicability-function parameter, respectively. At an intermediate value of the parameter a PageRank-like behaviour is recovered. As a test case, we apply communicability functions to two sets of articles, where at least one author of each paper was awarded a Nobel Prize for the research presented in the corresponding article.",

            "abstract": "Facility location games have been a topic of major interest in economics, operations research, and computer science, starting from the seminal work by Hotelling [Hotelling H (1929) Stability in competition. Econom. J. 39(153):41-57]. In the classical pure location Hotelling game, businesses compete for maximizing customer attraction by strategically locating their facilities, assuming no price competition, and customers are attracted to their closest facilities. Surprisingly, very little rigorous work has been presented on multiunit facility location games, where the classical pure location Hotelling games are extended to contexts where each player is to locate several facilities. In this paper, we present two major contributions to the study of multiunit pure location Hotelling games. In the first part of this paper, we deal with the two-player multiunit setting and fully characterize its equilibria. In the second part of this paper, we deal with multiunit facility location games, with N >= 3 players; our main result in this part is the full characterization of the settings where pure strategy equilibria exist. Our results also extend classical results on necessary and sufficient conditions for a strategy profile to be in equilibrium in a pure location (single-unit) Hotelling game to multiunit pure location games.",

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), for example, are one of the most important topics in computer science and computer engineering curricula. The teaching of ANNs, however, is challenging and current efforts are mainly focused on providing computer systems and/or software simulators to enhance results. In the present study, we introduce a field programmable gate array-based educational system focused on the modeling, implementation, and evaluation of hardware architectures of ANNs type Multilayer Perceptron. The system was designed by taking into account the learning by design approach to creating a modular proposal, which is composed of a set of predefined modules that describe the behavior of each element of an ANN. This feature allows various neural architectures to be easily defined and to be applied to different specific problems. The system helps the teaching-learning process by providing a design environment where undergraduate students can apply the knowledge acquired in lecture-based courses related to areas, such as pattern recognition and neural networks. The experimental results present the design and implementation of an ANN hardware architecture that solves the iris-plant problem.",

Physical activity in students is affected by several factors. The aim of this systematic review research was to identify the factors determining physical activities in students. Materials and Methods The search for detecting relevant studies was performed in electronic databases within the time range of 2008-2018. The studies were searched in Google scholar, Medline, Cochran, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Assessment of the quality of papers was performed using New Castle-Ottawa (BOS) scale. Then, the required information was extracted and the results were reported qualitatively. Results A total of 12 studies (including 41,407 year-old students) were enrolled in the research according to inclusion criteria. The demographic factors associated with physical activity included age, gender, academic degree of parents and economic status. On the other hand, the psychological factors were supported by parents, support of friends, and lack of time due to school homework, computer games, sense of laziness and self-efficacy, which had a relationship with physical activity of students. Further, the environmental determinants included climatic conditions, sports facilities and equipment, and lighting of passages. Conclusion In students' physical activity, factors such as demographic, psychological, and environmental factors are involved. Identification of these factors can be used in health promotion interventions and planning for students.",

Xenon ions in charge states q = 1-20 and energies in the range from 50 to 400 keV are incorporated into single-crystal silicon. Irradiation is performed in the direction not coinciding with the crystallographic axes of the crystal to avoid the channeling effect. The ion fluence varies in the range of 5 x (10(14)-10(15)) ion/cm(2). The irradiation by singly charged ions and investigation of the samples by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy is performed using an HVEE acceleration complex at Moscow State University. Multiply charged ions are implanted using a FAMA acceleration complex at the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences. The depth distribution profiles of the incorporated ions are found using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Experimental results are correlated with computer calculations. It is shown that the average projective path of multiply charged ions in most cases is shorter when compared with the average projected path of singly charged ions and the results of computer modeling.",

This argument is something defended both by existing regulations, norms and standards, and also business organizations and governments. Despite this acknowledgement, the reality is still far from the desired equality. For certain groups of disabled or impaired citizens, such as the visually impaired, the existence of e-accessibility compliance represents an opportunity to integrate, in a more simple and straightforward manner, their societies. Despite the existing poor results on e-accessibility compliance, the mentioned citizens insist on using digital devices in their daily lives. Even though, in the last decade, multiple standards and regulations have been published towards indicating how to develop accessible digital user interfaces, there are still two major issues surrounding its implementation: the complexity and disparity of the documents containing the abovementioned norms, and also the lack of e-accessibility know-how by software experts. With this in mind, a proposal for an accessible software development model that encompasses e-accessibility incorporation as one of the development process activities has been presented. This model might represent a very interesting support tool for software development organizations and a novel resource for learning and training institutions to be able to improve their computer science and informatics students' skills on e-accessibility.",

Metacognitive scaffoldings have been developed for some science subjects; however, not for algorithm-learning. The learning algorithm is different from learning science as it is more oriented to problem-solving; therefore, this study is aimed to describe the modelling, development, and evaluation of the adaptive metacognitive scaffolding which is dedicated for encouraging algorithm-learning. In addition, the authors present a new approach for learner modelling to find students' metacognitive state. Adaptivity of the scaffolding is based on the learner modelling. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed system, it is deployed in a real algorithm-learning classroom of 38 students. The class is randomly divided into two groups: experiment and control. Two parameters are measured from both groups, i.e. academic success and academic satisfaction. Non-parametric statistical test, i.e. Mann-Whitney U-test (significance level 0.01) rejects the null hypothesis (U-value = 86.5 and U-critical = 101). This result verifies that the academic success of the experiment group is significantly higher than that of the control group. In addition, an academic satisfaction survey shows that adaptive scaffolding is valid in assisting students while learning with the system.",

            "abstract": "In this context, a new boundary element algorithm based on the time-convoluted traction kernels is employed to evaluate the spatially varying earthquake ground motions of the Pacoima dam in the USA subjected to SH, SV and P incident waves. An accurate three-dimensional (3D) model of the dam canyon is implemented into the computer code BEMSA to investigate the seismic response of the dam. The analyses are performed in time domain with a linearly elastic constitutive model for the medium. This modeling procedure has been validated by the results reported in the existing literature. According to the results of this study, the response of the dam to earthquake waves is generally influenced by predominant frequency of the incident motion, surface topography, relative distance of observation points, and type of the incident seismic wave. For the cases considered, the incident SV wave has led to the maximum amplification of incident motions, especially at the left side of the dam. The results indicate that the proposed procedure can be employed for accurate prediction of a dam response during an earthquake.

            "abstract": "In many engineering applications such as mining, geotechnical and petroleum industries, drilling operation is widely used. The drilling operation produces sound by-product, which could be helpful for preliminary estimation of the rock properties. Nevertheless, determination of rock properties is very difficult by the conventional methods in terms of high accuracy, and thus it is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, a new technique was developed based on the estimation of rock properties using dominant frequencies from sound pressure level generated during diamond core drilling operations. First, sound pressure level was recorded and sound signals of these sound frequencies were analyzed using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Rock drilling experiments were performed on five different types of rock samples using computer numerical control (CNC) drilling machine BMV 45 T20. Using simple linear regression analysis, mathematical equations were developed for various rock properties, i.e. uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, density, and dominant frequencies of sound pressure level. The developed models can be utilized at early stage of design to predict rock properties. (C) 2019 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In this paper, the LIGHTAWE Monte Carlo simulation tool is introduced and presented. LIGHTAWE has been developed to provide case studies of light spread in powder materials for both research and educational purposes. The algorithms of LIGHTAWE are based on Mie scattering theory and Henyey-Greenstein distribution. LIGHTAWE simulates the light ray interactions and encounters the overall optical diffusion, transmission and reflection (amount and distribution) of granular structured layers. Two main options are included: (a) fixed light point sources within the layer (concerning optical diffusion for any structure of spherical particles embedded within a surrounding medium) and (b) light distribution of 62 specific powder phosphor materials under X-ray penetration. The above options make LIGHTAWE an available and useful tool for a variety of scientific fields and applications. The capability to alter a set of parameters and perform a countless number of probable and comparable simulations, can insight and further enlighten the research of light spread performance. Based on the Monte Carlo methodology, LIGHTAWE can overcome cumbersome analytical modelling, and can take advantage of computer science to perform experiments that would be otherwise impossible (i.e., the capability to design, evaluate and optimize virtual experimental set-ups of zero cost or with low risk actions) enhancing curiosity-driven future research. The manuscript demonstrates the physics, the treatment and the capabilities of LIGHTAWE as well as the corresponding advantages, disadvantages, benefits and limitations. Finally, a simulation example is presented in the Appendix section.",

            "abstract": "This paper considers recent studies of global environmental change and their impact on the deltas, social and ecological patches that epitomize an Anthropocene environmental dynamism. Looking into these delta studies, we explore an emerging imagination about human-planet relations. Specifically, we indicate that the relationship between the changing Earth and human activities depicted in these studies is comparable to the kind of affective relations to which the anthropology of science has recently brought attention. While affective relations as anthropologically described depend on the capacity of the body to be affected by other entities, global change research on deltas asks the public to imagine collective life, including infrastructure, land use, resource consumption, and companion species, as composite bodies affected by the changing planet. This imagination is made possible by analogies developed in the vicinity of the notion of resilience, a term that originated in mathematical ecology and complex adaptive systems in computer science. In exploring this interdisciplinary traffic of ideas and models, we elucidate an analogical imagination that crosses the border of machines and organisms.",

Various applications along with technical and theoretical advancements contributed to increase significantly the knowledge in this area. Nowadays, chromatographic techniques, in particular HPLC on chiral stationary phase, are considered as mature technologies. In the last thirty years, CE has been also recognized as one of the most versatile technique for analytical scale separation of enantiomers. Despite the huge number of papers published in these fields, understanding mechanistic details of the stereoselective interaction between selector and selectand is still an open issue, in particular for high-molecular weight chiral selectors like polysaccharide derivatives. With the ever growing improvement of computer facilities, hardware and software, computational techniques have become a basic tool in enantioseparation science. In this field, molecular docking and dynamics simulations proved to be extremely adaptable to model and visualize at molecular level the spatial proximity of interacting molecules in order to predict retention, selectivity, enantiomer elution order, and profile noncovalent interaction patterns underlying the recognition process. On this basis, topics and trends in using docking and molecular dynamics as theoretical complement of experimental LC and CE chiral separations are described herein. The basic concepts of these computational strategies and seminal studies performed over time are presented, with a specific focus on literature published between 2015 and November 2018. A systematic compilation of all published literature has not been attempted.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "There are two general approaches to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) 1: computer-science-oriented and neuroscience-oriented. Because of the fundamental differences in their formulations and coding schemes, these two approaches rely on distinct and incompatible platforms(2-8), retarding the development of AGI. A general platform that could support the prevailing computer-science-based artificial neural networks as well as neuroscience-inspired models and algorithms is highly desirable. Here we present the Tianjic chip, which integrates the two approaches to provide a hybrid, synergistic platform. The Tianjic chip adopts a many-core architecture, reconfigurable building blocks and a streamlined dataflow with hybrid coding schemes, and can not only accommodate computer-science-based machine-learning algorithms, but also easily implement brain-inspired circuits and several coding schemes. Using just one chip, we demonstrate the simultaneous processing of versatile algorithms and models in an unmanned bicycle system, realizing real-time object detection, tracking, voice control, obstacle avoidance and balance control. Our study is expected to stimulate AGI development by paving the way to more generalized hardware platforms.",

            "abstract": "Attempts to find new advanced methods for optimization and decision-making problems in controlling real tasks have become today's trend in mathematics, mechanics, and computer science and many other disciplines. Meta-heuristics approaches provide powerful means to find an algorithm based on nature or physical laws and phenomena such as Newtonian laws in collision (CBO), and space laws and parallel verses (MVO) and many other laws. The recently developed approach by Han and Kim (IEEE Trans. Evolut. Comput. 6(6):580-593, 2002) is based on quantum mechanics laws. A quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) uses Q-bit individuals in binary code analogous to genes in the conventional genetic algorithm. In different stages of iterations, the Q-bit solutions are updated using the prominent quantum gate rotational gate and HE-gate. This paper is devoted to the assessment of the QEA using some well-known optimization problems. QEA has excellent features such as practical exploration and exploitation of domain space due to utilizing a binary approach for generation of the solutions and rotational gate updating based on the probability of 0 or 1. Here, HE-gate and parallel phase are used to change the path of finding the optimal solution for escaping from local optima.",

Using the main numerical principles of colour harmony, borrowed from the psychological literature, this study aims to investigate the ways of mapping the extent of the colour harmony of land cover, based on satellite Earth observations and explain the spatial distribution of colour harmony scores. The naturalness of environment, as well as heat and moisture balance, are confirmed to be the main drivers of the colour harmony of land cover. Crowdsourced photographs, collected from Mapillary service, were used to link satellite and ground-based estimations of the colour harmony of land cover as \"proof of concept\". They have a limited applicability for ground-based assessment of scenic colour harmony. Therefore, remote sensing data provide a significant support for nature conservation and sustainable management, being used for mapping of the colour harmony of land cover as an indicator of the visual quality of the perceived environment.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "This paper improves the treatment of equality in guarded dependent type theory (GDTT), by combining it with cubical type theory (CTT). GDTT is an extensional type theory with guarded recursive types, which are useful for building models of program logics, and for programming and reasoning with coinductive types. We wish to implement GDTT with decidable type checking, while still supporting non-trivial equality proofs that reason about the extensions of guarded recursive constructions. CTT is a variation of Martin-Lof type theory in which the identity type is replaced by abstract paths between terms. CTT provides a computational interpretation of functional extensionality, enjoys canonicity for the natural numbers type, and is conjectured to support decidable type-checking. Our new type theory, guarded cubical type theory (GCTT), provides a computational interpretation of extensionality for guarded recursive types. This further expands the foundations of CTT as a basis for formalisation in mathematics and computer science. We present examples to demonstrate the expressivity of our type theory, all of which have been checked using a prototype type-checker implementation. We show that CTT can be given semantics in presheaves on CxD, where C is the cube category, and D is any small category with an initial object. We then show that the category of presheaves on Cx omega provides semantics for GCTT.",

            "abstract": "Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing-structure-property-performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers. This paper reviews the various developments in materials informatics and how it facilitates materials innovation by way of specific examples.",

In this article, we illustrate how a human resource management (HRM) simulation was designed, developed, and tested using design science principles to show how student engagement can be achieved with such digital tools. The findings of the testing process show that the type of Learning Management System used is less important than the novelty and perceived authenticity of the tasks.

Pore-scale imaging holds considerable potential for estimating volumetric and hydromechanical properties of rocks for a variety of geoscience applications. However, the micron-scale images, generated by the present imaging technology, are limited in resolution and thus a significant portion of rock pore volume can remain unresolved. We use the established concepts of capillary physics in rocks to infer rock porosity that sits in pores that are smaller than the image voxel without the need for higher resolution imaging that is only possible at the expense of image field of view or physical laboratory measurement. This allows us to estimate porosity of reservoir rocks using X-ray computer tomography even when a significant portion of pore volume is below image resolution. We find that the porosity inferred by our method matches the experimentally obtained total porosity for rocks. The proposed concept is also applicable to other modes of imaging, including thin-section light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron source micro-CT.",

Wireless mice were the subject of this study, which investigated the optimal size, color, and packaging style for various mouse products. First, this study involved assessment and comparison of the sizes of commercially available wireless mice. Five sizes of mouse were selected. We then designed experiments, and participants performed tasks and completed questionnaires. The results were collected and analyzed to select the optimum product size for users. The study examined the user's psychological and emotional responses to mouse color. By conducting semantic differential analysis, 16 colors were selected for psychological testing, and the results were analyzed to identify the most suitable color. Finally, we investigated the optimal packaging styles for mouse products. In the experiment, eight styles were combined with 10 colors to produce 80 packaging styles. We use the Likert scale to collect data. The results show that the black mouse and the size of 64.5 x 95 x 35 mm(3) are the most popular.",

Structural equation modeling was employed to test a hypothesized path model. The findings showed that students' engagement in games not only predicted their in-game performance, but also had an impact on science learning outcomes via the mediation of in-game performance. While competition alone did not have a direct effect on either in-game performance or flow experience, it was indirectly related to in-game performance via the moderation of students' engagement in games.

            "abstract": "This study investigated high school students' conceptions of technology-assisted science learning via drawing analysis, and explored how students with different degrees of computer experience and science learning self-efficacy may show different conceptions via their drawings. The participants included 335 senior high school students in Taiwan (179 male and 156 female). All of them were asked by guiding questions to make two drawings to represent their conceptions of technology-assisted science learning in actual and ideal contexts, respectively. Their background information including computer experience and science learning self-efficacy were obtained using self-reported questionnaires. Through drawing analysis, seven categories of conceptions of technology-assisted science learning were identified, including types of technology, location of learning, types of learning activities, content of learning, participants of learning activities, affordance of learning technology, and effects of learning technology. The results further revealed that the students' conceptions of actual and ideal technology-assisted science learning significantly differed in some sub-categories of all categories except the category of participants of learning activities. Moreover, students' computer experience and science learning self-efficacy may link to different conceptions of technology-assisted science learning. Future research and directions are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "While computer simulations are a key element in understanding and doing science today, their nature and implications for science education have not been adequately explored in the relevant literature. In this article, (1) we provide an analysis of the methodology and epistemology of computer simulations, aiming to contribute to a sound and comprehensive account of the nature of computer simulations in science education, and (2) examine certain implications for science education, particularly in terms of contemporary educational goals relating to scientific literacy. We describe methodological elements relating to processes, techniques, and skills required for the construction and evaluation of scientific simulations, and we discuss epistemological views of their reliability and epistemic status based on the relevant philosophical views. We then examine implications of these elements for the use of simulations and especially for supporting scientific practices in the classroom and the corresponding educational goals. Concretely, we compare educational simulations with those used in scientific research and with laboratory experiments, we discuss the question of the reliability of simulations used in teaching or in public information, and we give examples of their use for supporting NOS understanding and reasoning abilities. Finally, in the context of the philosophical discourse about scientific realism, we examine implications of the epistemology of models that concern the conception of the relation between scientific claims and the real world, which constitutes a fundamental epistemological basis for teaching the nature of science.",

            "abstract": "In science and engineering education, the use of heuristics has been introduced as a way of understanding the world, and as a way to approach problem-solving and design. However, important consequences for the use of heuristics are that they do not always guarantee a correct solution. Learning by Design has been identified as a pedagogical strategy that can guide individuals to properly connect science learning via design challenges. Specifically, we focus on the effect of simulation-enabled Learning by Design learning experiences on student-generated heuristics that can lead to solutions to problems. A total of 318 middle school students were exposed to a lesson that integrated design practices in the context of energy consumption and energy conservation considerations when designing buildings using an educational CAD tool. The students were pre- and posttested before and after the 2-week long intervention. The data analysis procedures combined qualitative with quantitative methods along with machine learning approaches. Our analysis revealed two distinct groups of students based on their learning achievement: the naive developing heuristic group and semi-knowledgeable fixated heuristic group. Differences between the groups are discussed in terms of performance, as well as implications for the use of computer simulations to improve student learning.",

The advent of Intelligent Systems will allow creation of research teams that combine the strengths of the human mind and computer processing to produce new research results. The efficacy of these approaches will require a solid grounding in cognitive science. Critical to this approach are databases, which are potentially transformative solely in their ability to allow access to data, in a primary form. Emerging more recently, however, is the concept of a dataguide, in which computer-aided analysis informs ongoing decisions about where and what data to collect. The creation of human and computer teams can expand the types of questions that can be addressed in structural geology and tectonics research, but it will take a community-based effort to understand the value of data to experts and how computers might aid an expert in the field.",

Originally applied to the study of multi-valued logics, this notion has then found plenty of applications, ranging from computer science to abstract algebra. In particular, an entailment relation can be regarded as a constructive presentation of a distributive lattice and in this guise it has proven to be a useful tool for the constructive reformulation of several classical theorems in commutative algebra. In this paper, motivated by these concrete applications, we state and prove a cut-elimination result for inductively generated entailment relations.

            "abstract": "In 1982, Trillas introduced the notion of indistinguishability operator with the main aim of fuzzifying the crisp notion of equivalence relation. In the study of such a class of operators, an outstanding property must be stressed. Concretely, there exists a duality relationship between indistinguishability operators and metrics. The aforesaid relationship was deeply studied by several authors that introduced a few techniques to generate metrics from indistinguishability operators and vice versa. In the last years, a new generalization of the metric notion has been introduced in the literature with the purpose of developing mathematical tools for quantitative models in computer science and artificial intelligence. The aforesaid generalized metrics are known as relaxed metrics. The main purpose of the present paper is to explore the possibility of making explicit a duality relationship between indistinguishability operators and relaxed metrics in such a way that the aforementioned classical techniques to generate both concepts, one from the other, can be extended to the new framework.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a mesh-free computational model for the simulation of high-speed impact phenomena. Within the framework of particle dynamics simulations we model a macroscopic solid ceramic tile as a network of overlapping discrete particles of microscopic size. Using potentials of the Lennard-Jones type, we integrate the classical Newtonian equations of motion and perform uni-axial, quasi-static load simulations to customize our three model parameters to the typical tensile strength, Young's modulus and the compressive strength of a ceramic. Subsequently we perform shock load simulations in a standard experimental setup, the edge-on impact (EOI) configuration. Our obtained results concerning crack initiation and propagation through the material agree well with corresponding high-speed EOI experiments with Aluminum Oxinitride (AION), Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) and Silicon Carbide (SiC), performed at t he Pram hofer Ernst-Mach-Institute (EMI). Additionally, we present initial simulation results where we use our particle-based model to simulate a second type of high-speed impact experiments where an accelerated sphere strikes a thin aluminum plate. Such experiments are done at our institute to investigate the debris clouds arising from such impacts, which constitute a miniature model version of a generic satellite structure that is hit by debris in the earth's orbit. Our findings are that a discrete particle based method leads to very stable, energy-conserving simulations of high-speed impact scenarios. Our chosen interaction model works particularly well in the velocity range where the local stresses caused by impact shock waves markedly exceed the ultimate material strength.",

This new class of WPB functions is not extended affinely equivalent to the known constructions. We also discuss the weightwise nonlinearity profile of these functions, and present general lower bounds on k-weightwise nonlinearity, where k is a power of 2. Moreover, we exhibit a subclass of the family. By a recursive lower bound, we show that these subclass of WPB functions have very high weightwise nonlinearity profile.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the diagnosis of bankruptcy firms has become extremely important to business owners, banks, governments, securities investors, and economic stake-holders, in order to hedge against financial damage. This topic has attracted the attention of many computer scientists, as well as the financial sector. In computer science, a predictive model will be developed to analyse a firm's financial statements to predict its fate in the future based on the existing bankruptcy dataset. Many machine learning models have been developed to predict bankruptcy using specific datasets. This manuscript proposes a fast and accurate approach that utilises GPU-based extreme gradient boosting machine using squared logistics loss (SqLL) denoted by gXGBS for bankruptcy forecasting on both scenarios, including an imbalanced dataset (Korean bankruptcy dataset [KRBDS]) and two balanced datasets (USA bankruptcy dataset [USABDS] and Japanese bankruptcy dataset UPNBDS]). To improve the performance of this prediction task, the study uses a custom loss function, namely SqLL, for an extreme gradient boosting machine to propose XGBS algorithm. Then, this study employs a GPU-based implementation of a decision tree construction algorithm (gDTC) to accelerate the processing time of XGBS. This is called a gXGBS algorithm. In addition, we also utilise a histogram-based tree construction algorithm using multi-GPU (gHTC), an approximation algorithm, for a gXGBS algorithm that will propose the third algorithm, namely gXGBS_hist, for the large datasets. The comprehensive experiments were conducted on three experimental datasets to evaluate the proposed approaches. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for bankruptcy forecasting in terms of geometric mean (G-mean), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and processing time for all experimental datasets.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Increased storm-water runoff and flooding and poor ecosystem health have brought increasing attention to catchment-wide implementation of green infrastructure (e.g., bioswales, rain gardens, permeable pavements, tree box filters, urban wetlands and forests, stream buffers, and green roofs) to replace or supplement conventional storm water management practices and create more sustainable urban water systems. Current green infrastructure (GI) practice aims at mitigating the negative effects of urbanization by restoring pre-development hydrology and ultimately addressing water quality issues at an urban catchment scale. However, the benefits of GI extend well beyond local storm water management, as urban green spaces are also major contributors to human health. Considerable research in the psychological sciences have shown significant human health benefits from appropriately designed green spaces, yet impacts on human wellbeing have not yet been formally considered in GI design frameworks. This work develops a novel computational green infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates storm water management requirements with criteria for human wellbeing. A supervised machine-learning model is created to identify specific patterns in urban green spaces that promote human wellbeing; the model is linked to RHESSYS hydrological model to evaluate GI designs in terms of both water resource and human health benefits. An application of the framework to tree-based GI design in Dead Run Watershed, Baltimore, MD, shows that image-mining methods are able to capture key elements of human preferences that could improve GI design. The results also show that hydrologic benefits associated with tree-based features are substantial, indicating that increased urban tree coverage and a more integrated GI design approach can significantly increase both human and hydrologic benefits.",

            "abstract": "Graph isomorphism phenomenon has been identified since the 1930s, which was first addressed in the graph-theoretical field and was thoroughly studied as a critical topic of computer science. In many research disciplines, isomorphism theory and dual principles are identified as powerful tools in the study of related subjects. However, during the development of power converters, only dual principles have been adopted, such as in the study of the relationships between voltage-source converter (VSC) and current-source converter (CSC), while the isomorphic relationship between them was never discovered. This, indeed, limits the understanding of the relationships among converter topologies. In this letter, such isomorphic relationships are first revealed in the power converter field. Several topologies are discovered as isomorphic pairs, and the modulation isomorphism between single-phase N-level VSC and N-phase CSC (N = 3) is also demonstrated. The experimental results verify that the physical meaning of direct pulsewidth modulation for CSC is the modulation process of the dc-side voltage of three-phase CSC, as its isomorphic pair shows. With the aid of isomorphic transformation, the existing knowledge of VSCs can be directly transformed into corresponding CSCs to deal with problems where dual principle has difficulties, which provides another opportunity for the innovation of power converters.",

A quasi-experiment was implemented by recruiting two English tourism classes of students from a university of science and technology in northern Taiwan. One class was scheduled to learn with the proposed approach, and the other was arranged to learn with the conventional contextual gaming approach. The students' writing performance, learning perceptions and generative uses were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It was found that, compared to the control group students; the experimental group students who learned with the proposed learning approach had better writing performance in the aspects of fluency and elaboration with a small effect size. Additionally, it was found that most students considered the game to be beneficial and interesting, and they were in favor of the mind mapping strategy. Moreover, it was also found that the proposed learning approach is more likely to help students produce positive thoughts and feelings, generate diverse ideas, create a sense of exoticism and express actions or intent of actions. Finally, the limitations of the study and some suggestions for improvement of this proposed gaming learning environment and approaches are provided.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of a computer-based graphic organizer (CBGO) with embedded self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies on the argumentative writing performance of 4th-and 6th-grade students, including advanced and struggling writers, in the inclusive social studies and science classrooms. This study extended previous research to examine how CBGOs with embedded SRL strategies can support students' writing across content areas. Sixty-nine (N = 69) students participated in a randomized control trial study. Quantity (e.g., number of words and sentences) and quality (e.g., number of transition words, holistic writing quality) of students' argumentative writing were measured at pretest, posttest, and maintenance test. Results indicated that all students regardless of their abilities and needs benefited from the CBGO with embedded SRL strategies. There were statistically significant differences between the experimental group that used CBGO and the control group that received traditional writing instruction in the quality of writing at posttest and maintenance. There were no statistically significant differences in the quantity measures (e.g., number of words). In addition, the experimental group generalized the improvements in written arguments in the area of social studies to writing in science. These findings add to the limited body of research on computer-based instructional strategies that support all students in writing across the curriculum.",

            "abstract": "We study convergence and convergence rates for resampling schemes. Our first main result is a general consistency theorem based on the notion of negative association, which is applied to establish the almost sure weak convergence of measures output from Kitagawa's [J. Comput. Graph. Statist. 5 (1996) 1-25] stratified resampling method. Carpenter, Ckiffird and Fearnhead's [IEE Proc. Radar Sonar Navig. 146 (1999) 2-7] systematic resampling method is similar in structure but can fail to converge depending on the order of the input samples. We introduce a new resampling algorithm based on a stochastic rounding technique of [In 42nd IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Las Vegas, NV, 2001) (2001) 588-597 IEEE Computer Soc.], which shares some attractive properties of systematic resampling, but which exhibits negative association and, therefore, converges irrespective of the order of the input samples. We confirm a conjecture made by [J. Comput. Graph. Statist. 5 (1996) 1-25] that ordering input samples by their states in R yields a faster rate of convergence; we establish that when particles are ordered using the Hilbert curve in R-d, the variance of the resampling error is O(N-(1+1/d)) under mild conditions, where N is the number of particles. We use these results to establish asymptotic properties of particle algorithms based on resampling schemes that differ from multinomial resampling.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The University Course Scheduling Problem (UCSP) is a highly constrained real-world combinatorial optimization task. Solving UCSP means creating an optimal course schedule by assigning courses to specific rooms, instructors, students, and timeslots by taking into account the given constraints. Several studies have reported different metaheuristic approaches for solving UCSP including Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Harmony Search (HS) algorithm. Various Swarm Intelligence (SI) optimization methods have also been investigated for UCSP in recent times and a few Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based methods among them with different adaptations are shown to be effective. In this study, a novel PSO-based method is investigated for solving highly constrained UCSP in which basic PSO operations are transformed to tackle combinatorial optimization task of UCSP and a few new operations are introduced to PSO to solve UCSP efficiently. In the proposed method, swap sequence-based velocity computation and its application are developed to transform individual particles in order to improve them. Selective search and forceful swap operation with repair mechanism are the additional new operations in the proposed method for updating particles with calculated swap sequences as velocities. The proposed PSO with selective search (PSOSS) method has been tested on an instance of UCSP for the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Khulna University of Engineering & Technology which has many hard and soft constraints. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method compared to other prominent metaheuristic methods (e.g., GA, HS). (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "BackgroundCyclin-dependent kinase subunit 1 (Cks1), as a highly conserved regulatory protein, has pleiotropic roles in cell cycle progression. As research progresses, increasingly more statistics show that Cks1 may be involved in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of a variety of tumors but the conclusions remain controversial. In addition, there has been no meta-analysis demonstrating the correlation between Cks1 and cancer. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of Cks1 in various cancers. MethodsSystematic computer literature retrieval was conducted on the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Stata SE12.0 software was used in the quantitative meta-analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk (RR) were pooled to assess the relationship between Cks1 expression and overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and clinicopathological parameters. ResultsNineteen studies were included, totaling 2,224 participants. High expression of Cks1 was significantly correlated with worse OS (HR, 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.18-3.14; p<0.001) and poorer DFS (HR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.83-4.08; p<0.001). In addition, high expression of Cks1 was related to lymph node metastasis (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-2.07; p=0.001) and advanced T stage (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25; p=0.005). ConclusionsHigh Cks1 expression predicted poorer prognosis and worse clinicopathological parameters in various cancers. Increased Cks1 could be a significant prognostic biomarker for poor survival in patients with various cancers.",

Communications in mobile opportunistic networks take place upon the establishment of ephemeral contacts among mobile nodes using direct communication. SIR (Sane, Infected, Recovered) models permit to represent the diffusion of messages using an epidemiological based approach. The question we analyse in this work is whether the coexistence of a fixed infrastructure can improve the diffusion of messages and thus justify the additional costs. We analyse this case from the point of view of dynamical systems, finding and characterising the admissible equilibrium of this scenario. We show that a centralised diffusion is not efficient when people density reaches a sufficient value. This result supports the interest in developing opportunistic networks for occasionally crowded places to avoid the cost of additional infrastructure.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: Childhood overweight and obesity are major health challenges in the United States. One of the recommendations to combat obesity is to maintain a healthy diet, which is often best supported by eating home-cooked meals to control cooking methods, ingredients, and portions. Diet control through home cooking is challenged because of the decline in culinary skills in the population and a paucity of effective culinary nutrition education (CNE) programs. Providing technology-enabled CNE (CNE-tech) to overweight and obese adolescents can equip them with life skills that can assist them in the future. Such skills can facilitate saving money, eating healthier, and creating social environments. In addition, CNE builds cooking confidence and food literacy that in turn can build adolescent self-efficacy, particularly toward managing their health behaviors. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potentiality of creating CNE-tech that could effectively lead to better self-care and induce sustainable behavioral change as it facilitates skill building, self-efficacy, and a pathway that enables overweight and obese adolescents to influence cooking habits in their family home and future dwellings. Our CNE-tech-proposed solution aligns with the goals of overweight and obese adolescents and also reflects existing theories about behavioral change. Methods: The design science study was completed in 2 distinct phases engaging overweight and obese adolescents, parents of overweight and obese adolescents, and the health care providers that treat adolescents with these conditions. Phase 2, our primary source of data, involved user-centered design methods including the following: (1) early stage prototype usability analysis, (2) semistructured interviews with 70 overweight or obese adolescents engaged in a healthy behavior program, and (3) semistructured interviews with 10 health care providers. Data were analyzed using constant comparison analysis to identify functionalities, design requirements, and inform the context of use of CNE-tech. Objective: This study aimed to inform functionalities, design requirements, and the context of use for CNE-tech that could enhance overweight and obese adolescents' healthy food literacy, cooking confidence, and general self-efficacy with regard to self-management to ultimately promote healthy lifestyle management. Results: Data revealed specific desired functionalities for the CNE-tech related to building cooking skills, populating a healthy recipe database, suggesting healthy alternatives, supporting the construction of a healthy plate, and the ability to share healthy recipes and cooking accomplishments. Moreover, the adolescents provided design requirements pertaining to the presentation (eg, vivid colors, semirealistic images, and cooking sounds), use of multimedia, and gaming. Data further revealed contextual factors, such as shared experiences with family members and enhanced continued use.",

            "abstract": "Cognition has been found to constrain several aspects of human behaviour, such as the number of friends and the number of favourite places a person keeps stable over time. This limitation has been empirically defined in the physical and social spaces. But do people exhibit similar constraints in the digital space? We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility and mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European country for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we find that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of applications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily decreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more complex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications get added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of individuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers) vs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile applications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts mobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and explorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings provide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and digital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social Physics and Computational Social Sciences.",

            "abstract": "Background: Machine learning (ML) has become a vital part of medical imaging research. ML methods have evolved over the years from manual seeded inputs to automatic initializations. The advancements in the field of ML have led to more intelligent and self-reliant computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, as the learning ability of ML methods has been constantly improving. More and more automated methods are emerging with deep feature learning and representations. Recent advancements of ML with deeper and extensive representation approaches, commonly known as deep learning (DL) approaches, have made a very significant impact on improving the diagnostics capabilities of the CAD systems. Objective: This review aimed to survey both traditional ML and DL literature with particular application for breast cancer diagnosis. The review also provided a brief insight into some well-known DL networks. Methods: In this paper, we present an overview of ML and DL techniques with particular application for breast cancer. Specifically, we search the PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Web of Science databases and retrieve the studies in DL for the past 5 years that have used multiview mammogram datasets. Results: The analysis of traditional ML reveals the limited usage of the methods, whereas the DL methods have great potential for implementation in clinical analysis and improve the diagnostic capability of existing CAD systems. Conclusions: From the literature, it can be found that heterogeneous breast densities make masses more challenging to detect and classify compared with calcifications. The traditional ML methods present confined approaches limited to either particular density type or datasets. Although the DL methods show promising improvements in breast cancer diagnosis, there are still issues of data scarcity and computational cost, which have been overcome to a significant extent by applying data augmentation and improved computational power of DL algorithms.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Memory formation in matter is a theme of broad intellectual relevance; it sits at the interdisciplinary crossroads of physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science. Memory connotes the ability to encode, access, and erase signatures of past history in the state of a system. Once the system has completely relaxed to thermal equilibrium, it is no longer able to recall aspects of its evolution. The memory of initial conditions or previous training protocols will be lost. Thus many forms of memory are intrinsically tied to far-from-equilibrium behavior and to transient response to a perturbation. This general behavior arises in diverse contexts in condensed-matter physics and materials, including phase change memory, shape memory, echoes, memory effects in glasses, return-point memory in disordered magnets, as well as related contexts in computer science. Yet, as opposed to the situation in biology, there is currently no common categorization and description of the memory behavior that appears to be prevalent throughout condensed-matter systems. Here the focus is on material memories. The basic phenomenology of a few of the known behaviors that can be understood as constituting a memory will be described. The hope is that this will be a guide toward developing the unifying conceptual underpinnings for a broad understanding of memory effects that appear in materials.",

While important, this perspective fails to grapple with the ways that our conception of what biology is and what it can do have been altered through advances in science and technology, particularly through the intermingling of computer science and molecular biology. Starting from the premise that biology has been informationalized, we argue that biological exchange is not only a threat to humans and the institutional structures they create, it is also, importantly, a political and economic opportunity for firms and core states involved in global health security, and one of the key bases for an emergent global political economy of health security.

            "abstract": "We prove the endpoint case of a conjecture of Khot and Moshkovitz related to the unique games conjecture, less a small error. Let n >= 2. Suppose a subset omega of n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn satisfies -omega = omega (c) and omega + v = omega (c) (up to measure zero sets) for every standard basis vector v is an element of Rn. For any x=(x1, horizontal ellipsis ,xn)is an element of Rn and for any q >= 1, let ||x||qq=|x1|q+ horizontal ellipsis +|xn|q and let gamma n(x)=(2 pi)-n/2e-||x||22/2 . For any x is an element of partial differential omega, let N(x) denote the exterior normal vector at x such that ||N(x)||(2) = 1. Let B={x is an element of Rn:sin(pi(x1+ horizontal ellipsis +xn))>= 0}. Our main result shows that B has the smallest Gaussian surface area among all such subsets omega, less a small error: integral partial differential omega gamma n(x)dx >=(1-6x10-9)integral partial differential B gamma n(x)dx+integral partial differential omega(1-||N(x)||1n)gamma n(x)dx. In particular, integral partial differential omega gamma n(x)dx >=(1-6x10-9)integral partial differential B gamma n(x)dx. Standard arguments extend these results to a corresponding weak inequality for noise stability. Removing the factor 6 x 10(-9) would prove the endpoint case of the Khot-Moshkovitz conjecture. Lastly, we prove a Euclidean analogue of the Khot and Moshkovitz conjecture. The full conjecture of Khot and Moshkovitz provides strong evidence for the truth of the unique games conjecture, a central conjecture in theoretical computer science that is closely related to the P versus NP problem. So, our results also provide evidence for the truth of the unique games conjecture. Nevertheless, this paper does not prove any case of the unique games conjecture.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: The internet's low cost and potential for high reach makes Web-based channels prime for delivering evidence-based physical activity (PA) interventions. Despite the well-studied success of internet-based PA interventions in primarily non-Hispanic white populations, evidence on Spanish-speaking Latinas' use of such interventions is lacking. The recent rise in technology use among Latinas in the United States, a population at heightened risk for low PA levels and related conditions, suggests that they may benefit from Web-based PA interventions tailored to their cultural and language preferences. Objective: The goal of the research was to examine participant engagement with various features of an internet-based PA intervention for Latinas and explore how use of these features was differentially associated with adoption and maintenance of PA behavior change. Method: Pasos Hacia la Salud tested a Spanish-language, culturally adapted, individually tailored, internet-based PA intervention versus a Spanish language, internet-based, Wellness Contact Control condition for underactive Latinas (N=205, mean age 39.2 [SD 10.5] years, 84% Mexican American). These analyses examined engagement with the website and explored how use was associated with adoption and maintenance of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) behavior. Results: Overall, participants logged on to the website an average of 22 times (SD 28) over 12 months, with intervention participants logging on significantly more than controls (29 vs 14.7, P<.001). On average, participants spent more time on the website at months 1, 4, and 6 compared to all other months, with maximum use at month 4. Both log-ins and time spent on the website were significantly related to intervention success (achieving higher mean minutes of MVPA per week at follow-up: b=.48, SE=.20, P=.02 for objectively measured MVPA and b=.74, SE=.34, P=.03 for self-reported MVPA at 12 months, controlling for baseline). Furthermore, those meeting guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for PA at 12 months (150 minutes per week of MVPA) logged on significantly more than those not meeting guidelines (35 vs 20 over 12 months, P=.002). Among participants in the intervention arm, goal-setting features, personal PA reports, and PA tips were the most used portions of the website. Higher use of these features was associated with greater success in the program (significantly more minutes of self-reported MVPA at 12 months controlling for baseline). Specifically, one additional use of these features per month over 12 months translated into an additional 34 minutes per week of MVPA (goals feature), 12 minutes per week (PA tips), and 42 minutes per week (PA reports). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that greater use of a tailored, Web-based PA intervention, particularly certain features on the site, was significantly related to increased PA levels in Latinas.",

            "abstract": "The subject of nanofriction having its origins in the late 19th century has slowly but surely started picking up lately. With rapid advancements in science and technology throughout the last century, understanding nanofriction has been gaining prominence. In this context, and in the current 21st century of nanotechnology, it is expected that nanofriction will play a predominant role, as we try moving forward to solve the most pressing medical and biological problems with the usage of nanobots. It is important to understand the challenges we have to encounter in order to solve these problems for the benefit of the human race. The availability of high speed computers and smart algorithms has made it possible to investigate the problems (as outlined above and many more) without compromising on the complexities involved. The focus of the present review is to bring together major theoretical/mathematical models and computational approaches to study friction at nanoscale. The role of adhesion in the estimation of force of friction at nanoscale has also been clearly outlined. A critical discussion on the significance of single and multiple asperity models towards estimating friction at nanoscale has also been provided. At the end, a short description on scanning probe microscopy in estimating nanofriction has been provided for the completeness of the review.",

            "abstract": "Objective Despite the existence of reviews which document the effectiveness of online therapies, there is little consensus regarding the exact components of online treatment delivery that are most effective in maintaining user engagement and reducing eating disorder (ED) symptomology. The current review and meta-analysis aimed to determine which components of web-based, ED self-help interventions are associated with lower attrition and improved therapeutic outcome. Method A systematic search of electronic databases (PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus) was conducted for published studies of web-based interventions for EDs and a meta-analysis of the final included studies was performed. Each intervention was coded across four dimensions, including the multimedia channels employed (e.g., text, audio, videos), degree of user interactivity (e.g., online self-monitoring, skills exercises), level of automated feedback (e.g., reminders, personalized feedback), and technological device through which the program was accessed (e.g., smartphone, computer). Results A final 23 papers were included. The results of meta-regressions indicated that higher scores on the multimedia subscale were associated with greater ED symptom improvement in treatment groups. Conversely, a higher degree of feedback in the treatment group was associated with a group difference in ED psychopathology favoring the control group. Other intervention components were not associated with treatment outcome or dropout. Discussion The results are discussed in relation to limitations of the scale used to quantify digital intervention features, as well as the limited diversity and technological sophistication of available ED digital interventions. Such findings indicate the importance of understanding the digital components, which differentiate online therapeutic programs.",

            "abstract": "Multi-emitter localization has great potential for maximizing the imaging speed of super-resolution localization microscopy. However, the slow image analysis speed of reported multi-emitter localization algorithms limits their usage in mostly off-line image processing with small image size. Here we adopt the well-known divide and conquer strategy in computer science and present a fitting-based method called QC-STORM for fast multi-emitter localization. Using simulated and experimental data, we verify that QC-STORM is capable of providing real-time full image processing on raw images with 100 mu m x 100 mu m field of view and 10 ms exposure time, with comparable spatial resolution as the popular fitting-based ThunderSTORM and the up-to-date non-iterative WindSTORM. This study pushes the development and practical use of super-resolution localization microscopy in high-throughput or high-content imaging of cell-to-cell differences or discovering rare events in a large cell population.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Microscopic polarization in liquids, which is challenging to account for intuitively and quantitatively, can impact the behavior of liquids in numerous ways and thus is ubiquitous in a broad range of domains and applications. To overcome this challenge, in this work, a molecular contact theory was proposed as a proxy to simulate microscopic polarization in liquids. In particular, molecular surfaces from implicit solvation models were used to predict both the dipole moment of individual molecules and mutual orientations arising from contacts between molecules. Then, the calculated dipole moments and orientations were combined in an analytical coupling, which allowed for the prediction of effective (polarized) dipole moments for all distinct species in the liquid. As a proof-of-concept, the model focused on predicting the dielectric constant and was tested on 420 pure liquids, 269 binary organic mixtures (3792 individual compositions) and 46 aqueous mixtures (704 individual compositions). The model proved to be flexible enough to reach an unprecedented satisfactory mean relative error of about 16-22% and a classification accuracy of 84-90% within four meaningful classes of weak, low average, high average and strong dielectric constants. The method also proved to be computationally very efficient, with calculation times ranging from a few seconds to about ten minutes on a personal computer with a single CPU. This success demonstrates that much of the microscopic polarization concept can be satisfactorily described based on a simple molecular contact theory. Moreover, the new model for dielectric constants provides a useful alternative to computationally expensive molecular dynamics simulations for large scale virtual screenings in chemical engineering and material sciences.",

            "abstract": "Environmental decision support systems (EDSS) are designed to assist natural resource managers and stakeholders to assess problems and select options for change. EDSS that combine community engagement in developing future scenarios with computer-based land use planning and modelling tools are widely used internationally. However, these EDSS are often not used after the research and development phase. To best understand why the EDSS are not being used in the long term, the end users of the EDSS should be consulted-a perspective that is lacking in the literature. The research reported here presents the perspectives of stakeholders involved in a community climate change adaptation project in western Canada. Evidence from the community suggests that this project was successful in instigating change. However, the EDSS was not used after the project's end. Our findings indicate that, from the end users' perspective, the project could have had much greater and sustained success had there been ongoing engagement and communication with them, particularly in the form of continued support for the use of EDSS after the development project.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: Undergraduate electrical-engineering courses are traditionally taught using the lecturing approach. As for all the teacher-centered approaches, the students perceive learning as an individualistic task and consider lecture-notes their principal information source. They tend to employ the minimum possible efforts to get acceptable marks and compete against other students for best scores. Learning theories considers learner-centered approaches, such as, inquiry, computer simulation, self-directed learning, cooperation and competition, valuable alternatives to the traditional lecturing approach. Purpose: This study aims to develop, apply, and assess a new teaching approach to teach electric filters. The new-approach aims to improve the electrical engineering students learning outcomes and achievement, learning autonomy, and students perception of the role of engagement and cooperation in learning. Sample: Sixty-four students voluntarily participated in the study. Thirty-two students voluntarily decided to participate in the new learning approach study-group, whereas the others played the role of the control-group and followed the traditional-teaching method. Design and methods: The design of the new-approach combines inquiry, computer simulation, and cooperation with intergroup competition. The new-approach is developed in two phases. In the first phase, the preparation phase, the students learned electric filters using simple inquiry, cooperation, and learned and applied computer simulation in filter analysis. The second phase was a face-to-face debate on filters. Data was collected using pre-tests, post-tests, questionnaires, direct observation, and student portfolios. Independent and paired T-tests were used to verify the study hypothesis. Results: The findings showed that, the student could learn autonomously. The new method improved the students learning outcomes and achievements. It also improved the electrical engineering students' perception of the role of engagement and cooperation in learning. Conclusions: The study showed that, following the new-approach improved the tackled electrical engineering students' characteristics and defeated some of the negative effects of the traditional lecturing. This leads to think that a long-term implementation of the proposed approach can provide the students with the essential attitudes and skills that serve their future as electrical engineering professionals.",

            "abstract": "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widespread in many natural sciences including chemistry, ecology, and systems biology, and in disciplines such as control theory and electrical engineering. Building on the celebrated molecules-as-processes paradigm, they have become increasingly popular in computer science, with high-level languages and formal methods such as Petri nets, process algebra, and rule-based systems that are interpreted as ODEs. We consider the problem of comparing and minimizing ODEs automatically. Influenced by traditional approaches in the theory of programming, we propose differential equivalence relations. We study them for a basic intermediate language, for which we have decidability results, that can be targeted by a class of high-level specifications. An ODE implicitly represents an uncountable state space, hence reasoning techniques cannot be borrowed from established domains such as probabilistic programs with finite-state Markov chain semantics. We provide novel symbolic procedures to check an equivalence and compute the largest one via partition refinement algorithms that use satisfiability modulo theories. We illustrate the generality of our framework by showing that differential equivalences include (i) well-known notions for the minimization of continuous-time Markov chains (lumpability), (ii) bisimulations for chemical reaction networks recently proposed by Cardelli et al., and (iii) behavioral relations for process algebra with ODE semantics. Using ERODE, the tool that implements our techniques, we are able to detect equivalences in biochemical models from the literature that cannot be reduced using competing automatic techniques.

Rubrics were used to measure the reflective writing and writing quality characteristics of student work, and a peer feedback coding scheme was used to determine the characteristics of the feedback students provided to one another. Results revealed that students' reflective writing and writing quality did not differ across projects and they offered solutions as their most common type of feedback.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Recent years have seen significant developments in Artificial Intelligence and we are now beginning to see some applications applied to sexual technologies. This has led to certain individuals and groups calling for a ban on the development of artificial sexual companions or \"sexbots\". This is largely due to fears that commercialising sex in this way could could re-enforce existing gender inequalities, and sexual objectification. We argue that one possible risk mitigation strategy could be to develop ethical safeguards into sexual robots. In this paper we explore the problem of implementing artificial ethical agents through a review of the relevant literature. We begin by exploring the motivation to the problem, and the science fiction that has inspired it. Following this, the practical, and philosophical implementation challenges are discussed before providing an overview of the current state of the art. The paper concludes by introducing the grand challenges of the field.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The present paper partly aims at exploring the potential of fractal geometry for concrete applications in the field of materials science. It is more specifically a study about the conception of hybrid polymer-based materials with photocatalytic activity. The concept behind this work is to investigate the use of polymer fractal structures manufactured by 3D-printing technology, as a highly ordered substrate with an important surface area to immobilize catalyst nanoparticles, by means of plasma grafting technology. Two types of fractal units, fractal pyramids (fracmids) and fractal cones (fracones), have been described and the former has been extensively characterized on a geometrical aspect. Various complex superstructures have also been described using fractal units as building blocks. 3D structures based on the aforementioned theoretical models have been designed using computer-aided design (CAD). On the basis of CAD models, several structures have been 3D-printed with PLA using fused deposition modeling. PLA substrates have been successfully coated with nanoparticles of ZnO using a combination of core shell synthesis and plasma grafting. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of a hybrid material has been assessed with a positive outcome, showing the relevance of the concept developed in this study.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) and Four-dimensional (4D) printing emerged as the next generation of fabrication techniques, spanning across various research areas, such as engineering, chemistry, biology, computer science, and materials science. Three-dimensional printing enables the fabrication of complex forms with high precision, through a layer-by-layer addition of different materials. Use of intelligent materials which change shape or color, produce an electrical current, become bioactive, or perform an intended function in response to an external stimulus, paves the way for the production of dynamic 3D structures, which is now called 4D printing. 3D and 4D printing techniques have great potential in the production of scaffolds to be applied in tissue engineering, especially in constructing patient specific scaffolds. Furthermore, physical and chemical guidance cues can be printed with these methods to improve the extent and rate of targeted tissue regeneration. This review presents a comprehensive survey of 3D and 4D printing methods, and the advantage of their use in tissue regeneration over other scaffold production approaches.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Research on collaborative learning has focused on its potential to foster successful problem solving. Less attention, though, has been given to issues of equity. In this article, we investigate how inequity can become amplified and attenuated within collaborative learning through small interactional moves that accumulate to produce broader patterns of equity or inequity. Our theoretical perspective utilizes Boaler's notion of relational equity and introduces what we term participatory equity. Research was conducted in a computer science course co-taught by the authors and taken by upper-elementary students. Data sources include audio recordings of students' collaborative interactions, ethnographic field notes, student work, and student surveys. This article focuses on a single student, Jason, and his dyadic interactions, and builds upon our previous analyses of his interactions with four higher-performing partners. Findings reveal how the interplay between classroom structures and student enactments shaped two types of inequity during collaborative learning. We conclude by discussing implications for theorizing and analyzing equity and inequity, as well as pedagogical considerations for structuring collaborative learning to attenuate inequity.",

            "abstract": "The study of psychological mechanisms is an interdisciplinary endeavour, requiring insights from many different domains (from electrophysiology, to psychology, to theoretical neuroscience, to computer science). In this article, I argue that philosophy plays an essential role in this interdisciplinary project, and that effective scientific study of psychological mechanisms requires that working scientists be responsible metaphysicians. This means adopting deliberate metaphysical positions when studying mechanisms that go beyond what is empirically justified regarding the nature of the phenomenon being studied, the conditions of its occurrence, and its boundaries. Such metaphysical commitments are necessary in order to set up experimental protocols, determine which variables to manipulate under experimental conditions, and which conclusions to draw from different scientific models and theories. It is important for scientists to be aware of the metaphysical commitments they adopt, since they can easily be led astray if invoked carelessly.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "The utilization of computers in all aspects and scales of chemical engineering, from fundamental understanding to solution of large-scale optimizations, is spreading quickly, hand-in-hand with access to data science and information technology. It is straightforward to involve computers and virtual laboratory tools into engineering education. This study presents the development of an interactive virtual laboratory method for a continuous binary distillation process. The three main steps, namely, mathematical modeling, model calibration, and graphical user interface (GUI) development are described and discussed in this paper. The model takes into account the specific needs of the simulator (fast run time) and limitations from the measurement system (calibration considerations). Then, it is validated based on temperature and concentration data from a lab/pilot scale continuous rectification column. The separation of an ethanol-water mixture is considered, the classroom example of distillation, which is, on the other hand, an azeotrope-forming nonideal mixture. The objective of this paper, beyond the virtual laboratory coding description, is to provide useful guidelines for a user-friendly and yet realistic simulator development for commonly available experimental devices in chemical engineering education. To fulfill this aim, MATLAB and LabVIEW, two routinely used programming languages by chemical and process engineers, are used.",

            "abstract": "The invention of the computer has led to the establishment of a new research paradigm, computation, which has recently become more and more popular in scientific exploration. However, computation is not well represented in high school and university curricula in science and engineering, although it applies to a wide range of disciplines beyond computer science and software engineering. In light of the increasing need to provide students with computational education, this paper presents a novel way to develop computational thinking among students. The proposed approach is based on the implementation of Papert's theory of constructionism in electronic spreadsheets. In this approach, students build their knowledge while constructing the difference equation that describes a physical (or engineering) phenomenon, based on specific cases investigated in the spreadsheet. The method does not require the students to write code or perform complex calculations in the spreadsheet and makes it possible to teach advanced subjects at a relatively early stage. The method is demonstrated through contents taken from the secondary and tertiary curricula in mechanics and electromagnetism.",

A sampling literature review has been conducted. A total of 804 papers have been identified and content analysis has been performed to mine knowledge in the domain for the years 2000-2016. The findings show that co-authors' backgrounds are from the subject areas of medicine and computer sciences. Most articles are experimental in nature and use modeling and machine learning techniques to exploit clinical data, for health monitoring and prediction purposes. Many articles are relevant to the medical specialties of neurology/neurosurgery/neuropsychiatry, medical oncology, and cardiology. Well-cited papers investigate the identification and management of high-risk/cost patients, the use of big data, Hadoop and cloud computing in genomics, and the development of mobile applications for disease management. Important is also the research about improving disease prediction by investigating patients' medical results using advanced analysis (such as segmentation and predictive modelling, machine learning, visualisation, etc.).",

Such boundaries may be labeled as semi-reflective, in that the time series values have an increased chance of returning towards middle levels as the boundaries are approached, but boundaries can still be breached. In this paper we review a model that was previously proposed for such data and we investigate its statistical properties. Specifically, this model consists of a third-order auto-regressive projection component, parameterized as a constrained linear combination of linear, flat, and quadratic trends, and an error term that uses a logistic regression model for its sign. We describe and compare a previously-proposed estimation method with a modified version thereof, using computer simulations, as well as data examples from heart monitoring and from a driving simulator. We find that the two methods tend to give different results, with the modified technique having lower bias and more accurate confidence intervals than the previously-proposed method.",

While calls for CS education are often framed in terms of national and economic competitiveness, there is a growing interest amongst equity scholars in curricular interventions that directly engage the ethical and sociopolitical issues surrounding CS and its role in society. Yet, less attention has been given to how sociocultural dynamics of classrooms play a mediating role in these spaces. Drawing on video data from an equity-oriented CS classroom, we argue aconflict that arose during design activities was rooted in alack of trust and solidarity between students. Ultimately, we make the case that in addition to curricular innovations, equity efforts in CS education must prioritize the cultivation of positive student relationships.",

The process of developing such an online environment is not only time-consuming and costly, but it would also require an extensive knowledge of computer programming. This is one of the main barriers to the proliferation of citizen observatories. Therefore, this paper develops a conceptual framework of a citizen observatory platform that does not require special skills or resources. It would enable the collection, analysis and exchange of quantitative and qualitative mobility-related data by citizens. We have reviewed 69 participatory sensing applications in the field of mobility to derive the essential building stones of such an observatory. We identified the requirements considering eight criteria: campaign management, objective, context, data types, sensing technology, motivation of data collectors, validation and representativeness, visualisation and reporting. Some concerns regarding representativeness of data, motivation of data collectors, accuracy of sensors and validated algorithms for indicators are also raised.",

            "abstract": "May 30-June 2, 2017, Scholarship for Service (SFS) scholars at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) analyzed the security of a targeted aspect of the UMBC computer systems. During this hands-on study, with complete access to source code, students identified vulnerabilities, devised and implemented exploits, and suggested mitigations. As part of a pioneering program at UMBC to extend SFS scholarships to community colleges, the study helped initiate six students from two nearby community colleges, who transferred to UMBC in fall 2017 to complete their 4-year degrees in computer science and information systems. The study examined the security of a set of \"NetAdmin\" custom scripts that enable UMBC faculty and staff to open the UMBC firewall to allow external access to machines they control for research purposes. Students discovered vulnerabilities stemming from weak architectural design, record overflow, and failure to sanitize inputs properly. For example, they implemented a record-overflow and code-injection exploit that exfiltrated the vital application programming interface (API) key of the UMBC firewall. This report summarizes student activities and findings and reflects on lessons learned for students, educators, and system administrators. Our students found the collaborative experience inspirational; students and educators appreciated the authentic case study; and IT administrators gained access to future employees and received free recommendations for improving the security of their systems. We hope that other universities can benefit from our motivational and educational strategy of teaming educators and system administrators to engage students in active project-based learning centering on focused questions about their university computer systems.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the effects of intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) treatment on retinal vein parameters and choroidal thickness used in the treatment of diabetic macular oedema (DME). Methods: This retrospective study administered Afyonkarahisar Health Sciences University Department of Ophthalmology. Twenty-nine patients who were diagnosed with naive DME in a single eye were included in the study. A three consecutive, monthly intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept were administered to patients. Each patient's contralateral (untreated) eyes, which did not diagnose DME and did not receive any treatment, were the control group. The central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), and artery-vein ratio (AVR) values were measured using a semi-automatically computer-based software before the first IVA injection and 30 d after the first, second, and third injections. The main outcome measurements were the central macular thickness (CMT), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), subfoveal choroidal thickness (sf-CT), CRAE, CRVE, and AVR. Results: The mean age of patients was 59.25 +/- 9.48 years. Patients were 15 males and 14 females. A significant vasoconstriction of the retinal arterioles, a thinning of sf-CT and CMT, and an increase of BCVA have observed in IVA-treated eyes compared to baseline (respectively, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). But, no significant differences were found for CRVE and AVR in IVA-treated eyes compared to baseline. No significant difference was found for all parameters in untreated eyes compared to baseline. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that IVA treatment can change retinal blood flow by reducing retinal artery diameter and thinning in the choroid.",

            "abstract": "This article presents findings from TechTales, a participatory design research (PDR) project where learning scientists, public library staff members, informal science educators, and staff members from Native-American-serving organizations collaborated to design a family-based robotics workshop that was grounded in storytelling. We approach this by engaging Indigenous ways of knowing and being from a sociocultural learning theory perspective. Through analyzing families-in-interaction as they constructed dioramas with robotics that told their family stories, we explore how cultivating consequential learning environments in STEM is intimately intertwined with historicity, knowledge systems, and the agentic positioning of learners to design new technologies. We find that using storywork as the design focus of building dioramas created learning environments where computer programing and robotics became dynamic tools toward family-making, collaboration, and the active presencing of Indigenous knowledge systems and cultural practices. Living and interrelating with story and its knowledge systems through making were enactments of Indigenous resurgence in everyday ways. From a structure of social practices perspective, this opens up learning spaces for engagement in STEM-Art practices and in relation to other social practices of consequence, such as cultural flourishing and affiliation, collaboration and family-making, and societal repositioning.",

However, AI has been creating much hype, too. In applying AI technology to patients, medical professionals should be able to resolve any anxiety, confusion, and questions that patients and the public may have. Also, they are responsible for ensuring that AI becomes a technology beneficial for patient care. These make the acquisition of sound knowledge and experience about AI a task of high importance for medical students. Preparing for AI does not merely mean learning information technology such as computer programming. One should acquire sufficient knowledge of basic and clinical medicines, data science, biostatistics, and evidence-based medicine. As a medical student, one should not passively accept stories related to AI in medicine in the media and on the Internet.

            "abstract": "Recent significant developments within process systems engineering demonstrate a need for more-flexible tools to handle the many diverse model-based tasks within product and process synthesis, design, innovation, and operation. Consequently, it is relevant to have a closer look at one of the modeling methodologies that have emerged. This paper addresses functional modeling for the purpose of the object system under investigation. The purpose of functional modeling is to represent the relations ships between the system goal and the underlying phenomena. The role of different aspects of functional modeling within the ongoing development of process systems engineering is analyzed. The fundamental principles of functional modeling for the object under investigation are presented and functional modeling hermeneutics are defined as translating the modeling goal into desired system properties, identifying the theory needed to model the system to represent these properties and identifying criteria for evaluation of system purpose and performance. Different types of functional models are developed, leading up to a discussion of their relation to quantitative computational physicochemical models. The application of functional modeling concepts is reviewed first for computer-aided molecular design then for process design, innovation, and finally for process monitoring including alarm handling. Within process modeling, it is demonstrated that functional modeling hermeneutics can be viewed as a common foundation for many different functional model types applied in diverse areas, such as monitoring, alarm handling, fault detection, and consequence reasoning, as well as for traditional simulation with computational physicochemical models. The concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics of modeling and design are suggested as being essential for chemical engineering science. The paper concludes that, with the desire for more-flexible tools within process systems engineering, it may be worthwhile to base such tools on the functional modeling paradigm as a common foundation for the different model types.",

            "abstract": "Recent scholarship in computer science (CS) education shifts from a focus on the technical-cognitive skills of computational thinking to the socio-cultural goal of computational participation, often illustrated as remixing popular media (e.g. music, photos, etc.) in online communities. These activities do enhance the participatory dimensions of CS, but whether they also support broadening the participation of underrepresented youth remains unclear. While online communities that are dedicated to computational participation have existed in the U.S. for over a decade, many communities of color remain underrepresented in CS disciplines. How might CS educators, researchers, and technologists promote culturally responsive forms of computational participation? To answer this question, we propose a culturally responsive framework for computational participation called generative computing. Generative computing approaches CS as a means for strengthening relationships between learning environments and local communities, leveraging culturally relevant sources of wealth generation in technology design and implementation. To explore this concept, we conducted a mixed-methods study with a cosmetology high school program that predominantly serves young African-American women. Through a series of computationally and culturally rich cosmetology projects, we tested our hypothesis that generative computing can enhance connections between Black heritage, CS, and cosmetology while supporting students' academic interests and knowledge.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Development of computer science has led to the blooming of artificial intelligence (AI), and neural networks are the core of AI research. Although mainstream neural networks have done well in the fields of image processing and speech recognition, they do not perform well in models aimed at understanding contextual information. In our opinion, the reason for this is that the essence of building a neural network through parameter training is to fit the data to the statistical law through parameter training. Since the neural network built using this approach does not possess memory ability, it cannot reflect the relationship between data with respect to the causality. Biological memory is fundamentally different from the current mainstream digital memory in terms of the storage method. The information stored in digital memory is converted to binary code and written in separate storage units. This physical isolation destroys the correlation of information. Therefore, the information stored in digital memory does not have the recall or association functions of biological memory which can present causality. In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary effort at constructing an associative memory system based on a spiking neural network. We broke the neural network building process into two phases: the Structure Formation Phase and the Parameter Training Phase. The Structure Formation Phase applies a learning method based on Hebb's rule to provoke neurons in the memory layer growing new synapses to connect to neighbor neurons as a response to the specific input spiking sequences fed to the neural network. The aim of this phase is to train the neural network to memorize the specific input spiking sequences. During the Parameter Training Phase, STDP and reinforcement learning are employed to optimize the weight of synapses and thus to find a way to let the neural network recall the memorized specific input spiking sequences. The results show that our memory neural network could memorize different targets and could recall the images it had memorized.",

            "abstract": "Modeling is as old as humanity. It is one of the ways in which we experience the world, teach our children, and entertain ourselves. The digital computer, on the other hand, is approximately 60 years old but as computing power increases and access to technology becomes easier, more disciplines are using statistical and computational simulations. From the humanities to social sciences, scholars are advocating for a computational branch of their field of study. This is very exciting, and we want to make sure that all disciplines stay connected and share their insights as they grow in their respective areas. Religion is a complex system that consists of humans, society, culture and social constructs that have evolved over millennia. The study of religion relies on empirical approaches to collect and analyze data to generate or validate existing theories. Modeling and simulation allows us to venture beyond statistical observation and into an exploration of the causal relationships between the different aspects of religion. It provides us with (1) the ability to understand the system as a whole, (2) the possibility of projecting how religion will evolve in the future and (3) the capability to compare, contrast and merge seemingly conflicting theories of religion. In this article, we present five critical things that scholars in psychology of religion should know about the discipline of Modeling and Simulation. The goal of this short primer is to highlight the universal aspects of Modeling and Simulation and to provide a unifying view that transcends disciplines.",

The purpose of denture marking thereby not only assists in the return of a lost denture but also facilitates the identification of edentulous persons who are either living or deceased. It is a very cheap, inexpensive, and simple procedure that has multiple benefits. There are different methods for denture identifications. Radiofrequency identification (RFID) is one of them. RFID is a small transponder that can be radio-transmitted to a reader connected to a computer. It is a cosmetic, effective labeling method permitting rapid and reliable identification of the wearer. Objective: This review highlights the different labeling techniques and procedures of RFID-tag in denture and its application. Materials and methods: Data were obtained and analyzed from previously published literature and electronic database searches of relevant published literature from PubMed and Google Scholar. Conclusion: Forensic identification using odontology is an old story in science. Denture itself reveals information like the number of missing teeth, which helps in identification of the person. But with development of newer techniques radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag into denture reveals much information about person wearing denture. It also helps in identification of body during mass disaster, dead and decomposed bodies during the burn and natural calamity. So, the study should be done on RFID tags for better understanding, to give more information regarding optimum designs.",

            "abstract": "Beyond the scope of thermal conduction, Joseph Fourier's treatise on the Analytical Theory of Heat (1822) profoundly altered our understanding of acoustic waves. It posits that any function of unit period can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids, whose respective contributions represent some essential property of the underlying periodic phenomenon. In acoustics, such a decomposition reveals the resonant modes of a freely vibrating string. The introduction of Fourier series thus opened new research avenues on the modeling of musical timbre-a topic that was to become of crucial importance in the 1960s with the advent of computer-generated sounds. This article proposes to revisit the scientific legacy of Joseph Fourier through the lens of computer music research. We first discuss how the Fourier series marked a paradigm shift in our understanding of acoustics, supplanting the theory of consonance of harmonics in the Pythagorean monochord. Then, we highlight the utility of Fourier's paradigm via three practical problems in analysis-synthesis: the imitation of musical instruments, frequency transposition, and the generation of audio textures. Interestingly, each of these problems involves a different perspective on time-frequency duality, and stimulates a multidisciplinary interplay between research and creation that is still ongoing.

In data science, new problems arose for the processing of irregular data such as social networks, biological networks or other data on networks. Graph signal processing is a promising approach to deal with those. The present text is an overview of the state of the art in graph signal processing, focusing on how to define a Fourier transform for data on graphs, how to interpret it and how to use it to process such data. It closes showing some examples of use.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective: This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods: We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results: A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions: Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians' experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.",

Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. However, self-management of the disease, especially keeping BG in the recommended range, is central to the treatment. This includes actively tracking BG levels and managing physical activity, diet, and insulin intake. The recent advancements in diabetes technologies and self-management applications have made it easier for patients to have more access to relevant data. In this regard, the development of an artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system), personalized decision systems, and BG event alarms are becoming more apparent than ever. Techniques such as predicting BG (modeling of a personalized profile), and modeling BG dynamics are central to the development of these diabetes management technologies. The increased availability of sufficient patient historical data has paved the way for the introduction of machine learning and its application for intelligent and improved systems for diabetes management. The capability of machine learning to solve complex tasks with dynamic environment and knowledge has contributed to its success in diabetes research. Motivation: Recently, machine learning and data mining have become popular, with their expanding application in diabetes research and within BG prediction services in particular. Despite the increasing and expanding popularity of machine learning applications in BG prediction services, updated reviews that map and materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies are lacking within the context of BG prediction (modeling of personalized profile) in type 1 diabetes. Objective: The objective of this review is to develop a compact guide regarding modeling options and strategies of machine learning and a hybrid system focusing on the prediction of BG dynamics in type 1 diabetes. The review covers machine learning approaches pertinent to the controller of an artificial pancreas (closed-loop systems), modeling of personalized profiles, personalized decision support systems, and BG alarm event applications. Generally, the review will identify, assess, analyze, and discuss the current trends of machine learning applications within these contexts. Method\" A rigorous literature review was conducted between August 2017 and February 2018 through various online databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and others. Additionally, peer-reviewed journals and articles were considered. Relevant studies were first identified by reviewing the title, keywords, and abstracts as preliminary filters with our selection criteria, and then we reviewed the full texts of the articles that were found relevant. Information from the selected literature was extracted based on predefined categories, which were based on previous research and further elaborated through brainstorming among the authors. Results: The initial search was done by analyzing the title, abstract, and keywords. A total of 624 papers were retrieved from DBLP Computer Science (25), Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics (31), Google Scholar (193), IEEE (267), Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (31), PubMed/Medline (27), and ScienceDirect (50). After removing duplicates from the list, 417 records remained. Then, we independently assessed and screened the articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which eliminated another 204 papers, leaving 213 relevant papers. After a full-text assessment, 55 articles were left, which were critically analyzed. The inter-rater agreement was measured using a Cohen Kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. Conclusion: Due to the complexity of BG dynamics, it remains difficult to achieve a universal model that produces an accurate prediction in every circumstance (i.e., hypo/eu/hyperglycemia events). Recently, machine learning techniques have received wider attention and increased popularity in diabetes research in general and BG prediction in particular, coupled with the ever-growing availability of a self-collected health data. The stateof-the-art demonstrates that various machine learning techniques have been tested to predict BG, such as recurrent neural networks, feed-forward neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing maps, the Gaussian process, genetic algorithm and programs, deep neural networks, and others, using various group of input parameters and training algorithms. The main limitation of the current approaches is the lack of a well-defined approach to estimate carbohydrate intake, which is mainly done manually by individual users and is prone to an error that can severely affect the predictive performance. Moreover, a universal approach has not been established to estimate and quantify the approximate effect of physical activities, stress, and infections on the BG level. No researchers have assessed model predictive performance during stress and infection incidences in a free-living condition, which should be considered in future studies. Furthermore, a little has been done regarding model portability that can capture inter- and intra-variability among patients. It seems that the effect of time lags between the CGM readings and the actual BG levels is not well covered. However, in general, we foresee that these developments might foster the advancement of next-generation BG prediction algorithms, which will make a great contribution in the effort to develop the long awaited, so-called artificial pancreas (a closed-loop system).",

            "abstract": "We prove two results, one semi-historical and the other new. The semihistorical result, which goes back to Thurston and Riley, is that the geometrization theorem implies that there is an algorithm for the homeomorphism problem for closed, oriented, triangulated 3-manifolds. We give a self-contained proof, with several variations at each stage, that uses only the statement of the geometrization theorem, basic hyperbolic geometry, and old results from combinatorial topology and computer science. For this result, we do not rely on normal surface theory, methods from geometric group theory, nor methods used to prove geometrization. The new result is that the homeomorphism problem is elementary recursive, i.e., that the computational complexity is bounded by a bounded tower of exponentials. This result relies on normal surface theory, Mostow rigidity, and bounds on the computational complexity of solving algebraic equations.",

            "abstract": "Diagnosis of melanoma (skin cancer disease) is a challenging task in medical science field due to the amount and nature of the data. Skin cancer datasets are usually comes in different format and shapes including medical images, hence, data require tremendous efforts for preprocessing before the auto-diagnostic task itself. In this work, deep learning (convolutional neural network) is used to build a computer model for predicting new cases of skin cancer. The first phase in this work is to prepare images data, this include images segmentation to find useful parts that are easier for analysis and to detect region of interest in digital images, reduce the amount of noise and image illumination, and to easily detect sharp edges (boundaries) of objects. Then, the proposed approach built a convolutional neural network model which consists of three convolution layers, three max pooling layers, and four fully connected layers. Testing the model produced promising results with accuracy of 0.74. The result encourages and motivates for future improvement and research on online diagnosing of melanoma in early stages. Therefore, a web application was built to utilize the model and provide online diagnosis of melanoma.",

There is an emphasis on integrating specific approaches to carry out testing activities in an effective mode; the efficient strategy being explored recently is adopting hybrid database approach. For this purpose, a hybrid algorithm will be proposed to ensure the functionality and outcomes of testing procedure. The technical processes and its impact on current methodology would help to evaluate its effectiveness in software testing through which specific conclusions could be drawn. The findings of the research will elaborate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm that would be used in software testing. It would be suggested that new technology is easier and simple to assess and analyze the reliability of the software. Basically, hybrid database approach comprises of traditional and modern techniques that are deployed in order to achieve testing outcomes. It is explored from various testing methods that challenges have been identified related to focusing on traditional techniques due to which hybrid approach is now being developed in most of the areas. In the light of addressing these concepts, the paper aims to investigate the complexity and efficiency of hybrid database approach in software testing, as well as its scope in the IT industry.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Purpose Undergraduates use electronic library resources for academic activities. However, literature has revealed that undergraduates' use of electronic library resources is low in Nigeria owing to attitude, computer literacy and information retrieval skills, while little attention was given to computer self-efficacy. This paper aims to examine computer self-efficacy as a predictor of undergraduates' use of electronic library resources in federal universities in south-west Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach The descriptive survey research design was adopted. Multi-stage sampling method was used to select 1,526 undergraduates from the population size of 30,516 from six federal universities in south-west Nigeria in four faculties (Arts, Engineering/ Technology, Science and Social sciences) and three departments from each of the faculties (English, History and Philosophy; Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering: Economics, Sociology and Psychology). Data were collected using a questionnaire and were analysed using descriptive statistics, mean and standard deviation, Pearson's Product Moment Correlation, hierarchical and regression analyses at 0.05 level of significance. Findings There was a significant relationship between computer self-efficacy and use of electronic library resources (r = 0.13, p < 0.05). The result of the analysis showed that computer self-efficacy influenced undergraduates' use of electronic library resources in federal universities in south-west Nigeria. Research limitations/implications - The data for the research were obtained from undergraduates in the selected faculties in the six federal universities except for two faculties which did not have some departments that were common to the selected faculties. Practical implications - The findings indicated that computer self-efficacy improves the use of electronic library resources for academic purposes. It therefore encourages the library management to provide the necessary support and training for the undergraduates to acquire the technical skills required for the acquisition of computer self-efficacy. This has greater influence on undergraduates' ability to use the computer maximally to access electronic library resources for academic purposes. Social implications - It will improve the undergraduates' use of electronic library resources for academic purposes. This implies that the undergraduates will have access to information around the world that could be useful for development in and around their locality which will become easily accessible. Also, in this era of computer, it will encourage reading culture among undergraduates. This could inform policymakers on the need to provide more electronic library resources for libraries. Originality/value The study provides original data on computer self-efficacy as a predictor of undergraduates' use of electronic library resources in federal universities in south-west Nigeria. This can provide valuable indicator for library managements considering enhanced utilisation of electronic library resources.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of innovative technology, coupled with IT being a core function in contemporary business, there has been an upward trend of multi-national companies (MNCs) reporting a skill deficit in areas such as data analytics and cybersecurity (Columbus, 2017. IBM predicts demand for data scientists will soar 28% By 2020. Forbes; NeSmith, 2018. The cybersecurity gap is an industry crisis. Forbes). In a recent survey with over 3,000 CIOs, 65% indicated their organizations were unable to maintain par with the progression of technology in areas such as data analytics and security due to a lack of adequate talent (Harvey Nash & KPMG, 2018. CIO survey 2018). Although, organizations have recently started to expand their talent pipeline following a neurological breakthrough: research as well as anecdotal evidence suggests adults with mild forms of autism display above-average intelligence, increased attention focus, and high visual-spatial abilities; a combination in high market demand for roles such as software testing, data analysis, cybersecurity, and engineering due to their uncanny ability with pattern recognition, information processing, analytics, and attention to detail. These auspicious developments come at the helm of an increasing rate of governments around the world implementing provisions to their labour regulations towards equitable hiring of people with disabilities (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). Some, such as France, Japan, Kenya, Korea, and Taiwan, have gone so far as to set quota targets (Myors et al., 2017. Perspectives from 22 countries on the legal environment for selection. Handbook of Employee Selection. 659-677. Research Collection Lee Kong Chian School of Business.). The implication for organizations is that they need to develop disability-inclusive recruitment and selection systems along with work designs and environments that are disability friendly. But what does this mean in practice? What does a disability-inclusive recruitment and selection system look like? Enter DXC Technology (DXC): born out of a merger between global conglomerate Computer Science Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, generating close to $25 billion annually in revenue, with clients across more than 70 countries, they strategically became a pioneer in the digital transformation that was taking place globally. In the wake of the breakthrough in employment diversity, DXC recognized this as an opportunity to gain a critical edge within the increasingly competitive talent pool market. First, design a program of their own for recruiting and selecting adults with high functioning autism. Next, through a collaboration with various universities including the University of Queensland and Macquarie University, Neurodiversity Hubs were established; an initiative designed to assist neurodivergent students with obtaining work experience and internships. In doing so, they faced the following key challenges: How could they design a recruitment and selection strategy for neurodivergent individuals that was equitable, ethical, and efficient? In particular, where could they find suitable neurodivergent candidates, what criteria should they use to select them, and how should they handle unsuccessful candidates to ensure beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders?",

Specifically, we discuss work from a range of research areas including plant biology, material sciences, fluid dynamics, and computer graphics. Treating plants as organized systems of information processing allows us to compare these different mathematical methods in terms of their expressive power of biological hypotheses.

While the classification of knowledge has been an enduring philosophical enterprise, it recently found applications in computer science, notably for artificial intelligence. The availability of large databases allowed for complex ontologies to be built automatically, for example by extracting structured content from Wikipedia. However, this approach is subject to manual categorization decisions made by online editors. Here we show that an implicit classification hierarchy emerges spontaneously on Wikipedia. We study the network of first links between articles, and find that it centers on a core cycle involving concepts of fundamental classifying importance. We argue that this structure is rooted in cultural history. For European languages, articles like Philosophy and Science are central, whereas Human and Earth dominate for East Asian languages. This reflects the differences between ancient Greek thought and Chinese tradition. Our results reveal the powerful influence of culture on the intrinsic architecture of complex data sets.",

Two instruments were developed and validated by two professors in the field of Library and Information Science with a reliability result of 0.82 and 0.84 respectively using Cronbach alpha procedure. The instruments were administered face-to-face to the same respondents who registered for the course in the first and second semesters with 100 per cent participation. The finding showed that a change from the traditional method of instruction to an inclusive LI with ICT integration has a significant effect on students' use of ICT tools and related IT facilities in private university. The study recommended that ICT-based courses should be inculcated in LI curriculum; ICT tools such as projector, interactive board, computers, laptops and Internet connection should be made available for use during LI course while librarians should support and instruct students to acquire ICT skill in order to use ICT-based library information resources effectively.",

Besides the computer science part, the material models describing the rolling parameters, microstructure evolution, phase transformations, and product properties are also presented. Effect of precipitation was accounted for various stages of the rolling cycle. Experimental tests were performed to generate data for identification of the models. These include plastometric tests, two-step compression tests, and dilatometric tests. Following this, physical simulations of rolling cycles were performed on Gleeble 3800 to supply data for the verification and validation of the models. Finally, case studies of modern industrial processes were performed, and the selected results are presented.",

Semi-stream processing is a particular type of stream processing where a stream of data is processed with a disk-based relation. A semi-stream join operator is required to implement this operation. Many semi-stream joins use a queue of stream tuples to amortize access cost for the disk-based relation, and use an index to allow directed access to the relation, avoiding the loading of unnecessary partition of R. In such a situation, the question arises which R partitions should be accessed, as any stream tuple from the queue could serve as a lookup element for accessing the relation index. Existing algorithms use simple safe and correct strategies, but are not optimal in the sense that they maximize the join service rate. This paper makes two contributions: first contribution is in terms of optimization in which we analyze strategies for selecting an appropriate lookup element, particularly for skewed stream data. We show that a good selection strategy can improve service rate of the existing join algorithms significantly. Second contribution is in terms of extension in which we develop multi-stage join for semi-stream join algorithms. Multi-stage join is important when stream data needs to be joined with two or more tables in the relation e.g., stream of sales data needs information to be added from product and customer tables in the relation. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing algorithms implement this feature. For the service rate evaluation we use two well-performed existing algorithms CACHEJOIN and HYBRIDJOIN. We evaluate the service rate using real, TPC-H, and synthetic datasets with a known skewed distribution. We also present the cost model for our multi-stage join.",

            "abstract": "Climate science is highly interdisciplinary by nature, so understanding interactions between Earth processes inherently warrants the use of analytical software that can operate across the disciplines of Earth science. Toward this end, we present the Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB, which contains more than 100 functions that span the major climate-related disciplines of Earth science. The toolbox enables streamlined, entirely scriptable workflows that are intuitive to write and easy to share. Included are functions to evaluate uncertainty, perform matrix operations, calculate climate indices, and generate common data displays. Documentation is presented pedagogically, with thorough explanations of how each function works and tutorials showing how the toolbox can be used to replicate results of published studies. As a well-tested, well-documented platform for interdisciplinary collaborations, the Climate Data Toolbox for MATLAB aims to reduce time spent writing low-level code, let researchers focus on physics rather than coding and encourage more efficacious code sharing. Plain Language Summary This article describes a collection of computer code that has recently been released to help scientists analyze many types of Earth science data. The code in this toolbox makes it easy to investigate things like global warming, El Nino, or other major climate-related processes such as how winds affect ocean circulation. Although the toolbox was designed to be used by expert climate scientists, its instruction manual is well written, and beginners may be able to learn a great deal about coding and Earth science, simply by following along with the provided examples. The toolbox is intended to help scientists save time, help them ensure their analysis is accurate, and make it easy for other scientists to repeat the results of previous studies.",

This special issue presents our vision for generating more analytical attention to the nature of industrial marketing work and to explore ways in which future research can contribute to this nascent research area. In this introductory article we seek to scope out an agenda for taking some of the themes of industrial marketing work further.

It is a subtle concept and a straightforward definition is not available. There have been many studies on its meaning and on the different metaphors used to describe it. The present work uses a pragmatic approach to mechanical energy and its conservation by using computer simulations inspired on the work of Chabay and Sherwood. We report the results of modifying the calculus based University Physics sequence at Northeastern Illinois University. The modifications include a revision of the laboratory activities adding computer based activities to the more traditional hands on measurements. A more substantial change was the inclusion of mini-research projects that were part of the National Science Foundation-Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (NSF-IUSE) funded project Peer Enhanced Experiential Research in STEM (PEERS). In this manuscript, we discuss a student project that helps us understand energy, energy exchanges, and energy conservation. We discuss how the chosen student project helps in the understanding on how conserving potentials can lead to apparent non-energy conservation.",

Meanwhile, Learning Management Systems (LMS) and eTextbook systems are also becoming more sophisticated in their ability to use standard protocols to make use of third party smart learning objects. But at this time, educational tool developers do not always make best use of the interoperability standards and need exemplars to guide and motivate their development efforts. In this paper we present a case study where the two large educational ecosystems use the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard to allow cross-sharing of their educational materials. At the end of our development process, Virginia Tech's OpenDSA eTextbook system became able to import materials from Aalto University's ACOS smart learning content server, such as python programming exercises and Parsons problems. Meanwhile, University of Pittsburgh's Mastery Grids (which already uses the ACOS exercises) was made to support CodeWorkout programming exercises (a system already used within OpenDSA).

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a proposed approach to estimate the optimal parameters of the photovoltaic (PV) modules using in-field outdoor measurements and manufacturers' datasheet as well as employing the nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm. The main goal is to determine the optimal parameter values of the implemented model which are: series resistance, reverse saturation current, photocurrent, ideality factor and shunt resistance in case of the five parameters model. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet is developed in order to perform modeling and analysis of the parameters analytical initial values using manufacturer datasheet specifications regarding to the changing in solar irradiance and ambient temperature. Then, the sum of the squared residuals between in-field measured and simulated data are calculated and minimized using Excel solver in order to obtain the optimal values of the parameters simultaneously, to describe the best fit for the outdoor measured data. The proposed approach is used to find the optimal parameters of the PV module TRINA TSM-295 using an array tester. The convergence confidences of the estimated parameters are presented and assessed in an easy way. This approach allows all parameters to be optimized, simultaneously. The results are verified and compared with other research studies for different PV cell technologies. The obtained results are useful for the tested PV module manufacturer and assess the performance of the products in different weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "Background: Bioactive peptides derived from food are important sources for alternative medicine and possess therapeutic activity. Several biochemical methods have been achieved to isolate bioactive peptides from food, which are tedious and time consuming. In silico methods are an alternative process to reduce cost and time with respect to bioactive peptide production. In this paper, FeptideDB was used to collect bioactive peptide (BP) data from both published research articles and available bioactive peptide databases. FeptideDB was developed to assist in forecasting bioactive peptides from food by combining peptide cleavage tools and database matching. Furthermore, this application was able to predict the potential of cleaved peptides from 'enzyme digestion module' to identify new ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors using an automatic molecular docking approach. Results: The FeptideDB web application contains tools for generating all possible peptides cleaved from input protein by various available enzymes. This database was also used for analysis and visualization to assist in bioactive peptide discovery. One module of FeptideDB has the ability to create 3-dimensional peptide structures to further predict inhibitors for the target protein, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme). Conclusions: FeptideDB is freely available to researchers who are interested in exploring bioactive peptides. The FeptideDB interface is easy to use, allowing users to rapidly retrieve data based on desired search criteria. FeptideDB is freely available at http://www4g.biotec.or.th/FeptideDB/. Ultimately, FeptideDB is a computational aid for assessing peptide bioactivities.",

A more skilled testing team can achieve higher rates of debugging success, and thereby removing a larger fraction of faults identified without introducing additional faults. A complex software is often subject to two or more stages of testing that exhibits distinct rates of fault discovery. This paper proposes a two-stage Enhanced neighborhood-based particle swarm optimization (NPSO) technique with the assimilation of the three conventional non homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) based growth models of software reliability by introducing an additional fault introduction parameter. The proposed neuro and swarm recurrent neural network model is compared with similar models, to demonstrate that in some cases the additional fault introduction parameter is appropriate. Both the theoretical and predictive measures of goodness of fit are used for demonstration using data sets through NPSO.",

Answering our research question, \"What guidelines may provide to future research, the key themes and concepts found in published scientific papers on gamification?\", we conclude that the researchers identified eight themes (gamification; game; use; users; business; points; engagement; learning) and twenty-eight related concepts. The present systematic review contributes to establishing possible guidelines for prospective studies, based on the analyzed papers, considering particularly their 'Conclusions' and on the 'Future research' sections, integrating game design contents in business, learning and education.

Furthermore, cloud computing environments are required to provide a high Quality of Service (QoS) to their clients and, therefore, need to handle power shortages. An optimized virtual machine allocation to physical hosts lowers energy consumption and allows for high-quality services. In this study, a novel solution was proposed for the allocation of virtual machines to physical hosts in cloud data centers using the Krill Herd algorithm, which is the fastest collective intelligence algorithm recently introduced. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the CloudSim simulator, and the results are suggestive of a 35% reduction in energy consumption.",

Idempotent factorizations with (p) over bar and (q) over bar prime have received the most attention due to their cryptographic advantages, but there are an infinite number of n with idempotent factorizations containing composite (p) over bar and/or (q) over bar. Idempotent factorizations are exactly those (p) over bar and (q) over bar that generate correctly functioning keys in the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) 2-prime protocol with n as the modulus. While the resulting (p) over bar and (q) over bar have no cryptographic utility and therefore should never be employed in that capacity, idempotent factorizations warrant study in their own right as they live at the intersection of multiple hard problems in computer science and number theory. We present some analytical results here. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally idempotent integers, those n for which all bipartite factorizations are idempotent.

            "abstract": "Adequate illuminance has a great effect on the health, comfort, and performance of pupils. It can be achieved by either artificial lighting or daylighting. Daylighting is usually preferred due to psychological, physiological, and economic purposes. This study aims to improve the daylight provision in existing classrooms, by investigating various retrofit methods for passive daylighting techniques in northerly oriented classrooms at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). Data for this research are obtained using computer simulation. The retrofit methods are evaluated in terms of illuminance levels on the desks plane and the chalkboard. The retrofit methods investigated in this study included improving the material reflectance, adding clerestory to the classroom, lightshelves, anidolic ducts, as well as various combinations between these cases. By comparing the results, and in light of the recommended lighting level by The Lighting Guide 5: Lighting for Education released by Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) in 2011, the combination of the clerestory window and the anidolic ducts result in the best results. While CIBSE recommended a target illuminance of 300 lx on desks plane and 500 lx on the board, the combination registers an average of 249 lx-300 lx on the desks plane in all sensors compared to 42 lx-105 lx in the base case, and an average of 275 lx-345 lx on the board for the tested dates compared to an average of 45 lx-115 lx in the base case.",

            "abstract": "Shared resource laboratories (SRLs) offer instrumentation, training, and support to investigators and play an important role in the progress and development of science. To facilitate daily tasks and to provide an effective service, we have made use of computer scripts; a list of computer commands that are processed sequentially, to automate tasks in our flow cytometry facility. Using Python and an application programming interface (API), we automate user communication and produce a daily schedule display screen. We exploit the accessible nature of open standards to use R and Python to analyze and backup data from the BD Influx cell sorter. Finally, we show that through simple scripting, we can add value to an existing service by producing sort statistics from the Beckman Coulter XDP cell sorter. With these five examples, we demonstrate and wish to inspire other SRLs that the use of scripts helps to improve work efficiency, can solve problems, and can enhance the service provided by the SRL.

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Overlay analysis is a common task in geographic computing that is widely used in geographic information systems, computer graphics, and computer science. With the breakthroughs in Earth observation technologies, particularly the emergence of high-resolution satellite remote-sensing technology, geographic data have demonstrated explosive growth. The overlay analysis of massive and complex geographic data has become a computationally intensive task. Distributed parallel processing in a cloud environment provides an efficient solution to this problem. The cloud computing paradigm represented by Spark has become the standard for massive data processing in the industry and academia due to its large-scale and low-latency characteristics. The cloud computing paradigm has attracted further attention for the purpose of solving the overlay analysis of massive data. These studies mainly focus on how to implement parallel overlay analysis in a cloud computing paradigm but pay less attention to the impact of spatial data graphics complexity on parallel computing efficiency, especially the data skew caused by the difference in the graphic complexity. Geographic polygons often have complex graphical structures, such as many vertices, composite structures including holes and islands. When the Spark paradigm is used to solve the overlay analysis of massive geographic polygons, its calculation efficiency is closely related to factors such as data organization and algorithm design. Considering the influence of the shape complexity of polygons on the performance of overlay analysis, we design and implement a parallel processing algorithm based on the Spark paradigm in this paper. Based on the analysis of the shape complexity of polygons, the overlay analysis speed is improved via reasonable data partition, distributed spatial index, a minimum boundary rectangular filter and other optimization processes, and the high speed and parallel efficiency are maintained.",

However, soft computing research devoted to finite precision effects in chaotic system simulations is still in a nascent stage, and there are ample opportunities for new discoveries. In this paper, we consider the error that is due to finite precision in the simulation of chaotic systems. We present a generalized version of the lower bound error using an arbitrary number of natural interval extensions. The lower bound error has been used to simulate a chaotic system with lower and upper bounds. The width of this interval does not diverge, which is an advantage compared to other techniques. We illustrate our approach on three systems, namely the logistic map, the Singer map and the Chua circuit. Moreover, we validate the method by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "In this article, we discuss several computer science problems, inspired by our 15-year-long collaboration with Prof. Eric Davidson, focusing on computer science contributions to the study of the regulatory genome. Our joint study was inspired by his lifetime trailblazing research program rooted in causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs), system completeness, genomic Boolean logic, and genomically encoded regulatory information. We present first four inspiring questions that Eric Davidson asked, and the follow-up, namely, seven technical problems, fully or partially resolved with the methods of computer science. At the center, and unifying the intellectual backbone of those technical challenges, stands \"Causality.'' Our collaboration produced the causalityinferred cisGRN-Lexicon database, containing the cis-regulatory architecture (CRA) of 600+ transcription factor (TF)-encoding genes and other regulatory genes, in eight species: human, mouse, fruit fly, sea urchin, nematode, rat, chicken, and zebrafish. These CRAs are causality-inferred regulatory regions of genes, derived experimentally through the experimental method called \"cis-regulatory analysis'' ( also known as the \"Davidson criteria''). In this research program, causality challenges for computer science show up in two components: ( 1) how to define data structures that represent the causality-inferred, by the Davidson criteria, DNA structure data and to define a versatile software system to host them; and ( 2) how to identify by automated software for text analysis the experimental technical articles applying the Davidson criteria to the analysis to genes. We next present the cisGRN-Lexicon Meta-Analysis ( Part I). We conclude the article with some reflections on epistemology and philosophy themes concerning the role of causality, logic, and proof in the emerging elegant mathematical theory and practice of the regulatory genome. It is challenging to explain what \"explanation'' is, and to understand what \"understanding'' is, when the technical task is to \"prove'' system-level causality completeness of a 50-gene causal GRN. Within the Peter-Davidson Boolean GRN model, the Peter-Davidson completeness \"theorem'' provides a seminal answer: Experimental causality system completeness = Computational exact prediction completeness. The article is organized as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to our Prof. Eric Davidson. Section 3 gives a brief introduction for computer scientists to the regulatory genome and its information processing operations in terms similar to the electronic computer. Section 4 proposes to honor Eric Davidson's life-long scientific work on the regulatory genome by naming a most fundamental time unit constant after him. Section 5 presents four grand challenge questions that Eric Davidson asked, and seven follow-up problems inspired by the first two questions, which we fully or partially solved together. Central to the mentioned solutions is our construction of the cisGRN-Lexcion, the database of causally inferred CRA of 600+ regulatory genes in eight species. Section 6 presents Part I of the cisGRN-Lexcion Meta-Analysis, coached as \"rules'' of the genomic cis-regulatory code. Section 7 is devoted to reflections on epistemological and philosophical themes: causality, logic, and proof in the elegant mathematical modeling of the regulatory genome. We present here the \"Davidsonian Causal Systems Biology Axioms,'' which guide us toward understanding of the meaning of \"proving'' causality completeness, for a complex experimental system, by exact computational predictions.",

            "abstract": "The regulatory genome controls genome activity throughout the life of an organism. This requires that complex information processing functions are encoded in, and operated by, the regulatory genome. Although much remains to be learned about how the regulatory genome works, we here discuss two cases where regulatory functions have been experimentally dissected in great detail and at the systems level, and formalized by computational logic models. Both examples derive from the sea urchin embryo, but assess two distinct organizational levels of genomic information processing. The first example shows how the regulatory system of a single gene, endo16, executes logic operations through individual transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory modules that control the expression of this gene. The second example shows information processing at the gene regulatory network (GRN) level. The GRN controlling development of the sea urchin endomesoderm has been experimentally explored at an almost complete level. A Boolean logic model of this GRN suggests that the modular logic functions encoded at the single-gene level show compositionality and suffice to account for integrated function at the network level. We discuss these examples both from a biological-experimental point of view and from a computer science-informational point of view, as both illuminate principles of how the regulatory genome works.",

Molecular computing is a branch of computing that uses DNA, biochemistry, and molecular biology hardware, instead of traditional silicon-based computer technologies. Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments, and applications of molecular computing. The core advantage of molecular computing is its potential to pack vastly more circuitry onto a microchip than silicon will ever be capable of-and to do it cheaply. Molecules are only a few nanometers in size, making it possible to manufacture chips that contain billions-even trillions-of switches and components. To develop molecular computers, computer scientists must draw on expertise in subjects not usually associated with their field, including organic chemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering, and smart materials. Bioinformatics works on the contrary; bioinformatics researchers develop novel algorithms or software tools for computing or predicting the molecular structure or function. Molecular computing and bioinformatics pay attention to the same object, and have close relationships, but work toward different orientations.",

            "language": "English",
            "abstract": "Metrics analysis of journal content has become an important point for debate and discussion in research and in higher education. The South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science (SAJLIS), a premier journal in the library and information science (LIS) field in South Africa, in its 85-year history, has had multiple editors and many contributing authors and has published over 80 volumes and 160 issues on a diversity of topics reflective of LIS theory, policy and practice. However, how discoverable and accessible has the LIS scholarship carried by the Journal been to its intended readership? SAJLIS transitioned to open access in 2012 and this new format in scholarly communication impacted the Journal significantly. The purpose of this paper is to report on a multiple metrics analysis of discoverability and accessibility of LIS scholarship via SAJLIS from 2012 to 2017. The inquiry takes a quantitative approach within a post-positivist paradigm involving computer-generated numerical data as well as manual data mining for extraction of qualitative elements. In using such a multiple metrics analysis to ascertain the discoverability and accessibility of LIS scholarship via SAJLIS in the period 2012 to 2017, the study employs performance metrics theory to guide the analysis. We highlight performance strengths of SAJLIS in terms of discoverability and accessibility of the scholarship it conveys; identify possible growth areas for strategic planning for the next 5 years; and make recommendations for further study for a more complete picture of performance strengths and areas for improvement. Significance: The importance of discoverability and accessibility of scholarship carried by a scholarly journal is conveyed. The need to use multiple metrics for objective evaluation of the discoverability and accessibility of the scholarly content of a journal is emphasised. The impact of open access on the discoverability and accessibility of the content of a scholarly journal is assessed.",

            "abstract": "The presented framework enables capturing video streams from cameras with a Camera Link interface. It is designed for scalable high-reliability industrial and scientific applications. The solution performs data capture, optionally processing it, and delivers it to a host CPU. It consists of an MTCA. 4-compliant frame grabber, its firmware, and a set of software components supporting several different cameras. The framework is focused on Xilinx 7-Series field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits. These have I/O pins fast enough to deserialize the Camera Link streams without use of any external components. The reference implementation runs on a hardware platform composed of a dual-slot FMC carrier module equipped with a modern Artix-7 FPGA and up to two Camera Link pass-through modules. The video stream is written to the host computer memory by a custom scatter-gather direct memory access (DMA) engine developed at the Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science (DMCS) of Lodz University of Technology. The framework also includes complete software support consisting of a Linux device driver, application programming interface libraries as well as console and graphical user applications. The proposed video acquisition solution is the world's first Camera Link frame grabber for the MTCA. 4 architecture. It enables collecting data from the camera using the top performance 80-bit Camera Link interface, offering 6.8 Gb/s of raw image data throughput. The solution was tested with a number of commercially available cameras.",
